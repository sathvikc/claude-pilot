    question: "Do I need a separate Anthropic subscription?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Pilot Shell enhances Claude Code \u2014 it doesn't replace it. You need an active Claude subscription \u2014 Max 5x or 20x for solo developers, or Team Premium for teams and companies. Using the Anthropic API directly is also possible but may lead to much higher costs. Pilot Shell adds quality automation on top of whatever Claude Code access you already have.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is Pilot Shell enterprise-compliant for data privacy?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Your source code, project files, and development context never leave your machine through Pilot Shell. The only external calls are license validation (daily, license key only) and one-time activation/trial start (machine fingerprint only). No OS info, no version strings, no analytics, no telemetry. Enterprises using Claude Code with their own API key or Anthropic Enterprise subscription can add Pilot Shell without changing their data compliance posture.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "Does Pilot Shell work with other AI coding tools?",
    answer:
      "Pilot Shell is built for Claude Code. Every hook, rule, command, and workflow is engineered specifically for Claude\u2019s tool-use protocol, prompt format, and session lifecycle. Pilot Shell supports Claude Sonnet 4.6 and Claude Opus 4.7 \u2014 these are the models that produce the best results, and every rule and prompt is optimized for their behavior. Additionally, the optional Codex plugin adds OpenAI-powered adversarial review during /spec \u2014 an independent second opinion on your plans and code changes. Codex reviewers are disabled by default and can be enabled in Console Settings.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Pilot Shell work with existing projects?",
    answer:
      "Yes \u2014 that's the primary use case. Pilot Shell doesn't scaffold or restructure your code. You install it, run /setup-rules, and it explores your codebase to discover your tech stack, conventions, and patterns. From there, every session has full context about your project. The more complex and established your codebase, the more value Pilot Shell adds \u2014 quality hooks catch regressions, persistent memory preserves decisions across sessions, and /spec plans features against your real architecture.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Pilot Shell work with any programming language?",
    answer:
      "Pilot Shell's quality hooks (auto-formatting, linting, type checking) currently support Python, TypeScript/JavaScript, and Go out of the box. TDD enforcement, spec-driven development, persistent memory, context optimization, and all rules and standards work with any language that Claude Code supports. You can add custom hooks for additional languages.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use one license on multiple machines?",
    answer:
      "Yes. A Solo license covers you across all your personal devices \u2014 workstation, laptop, VPS, cloud instances. One subscription, one key, multiple machines. No need for a Team plan just because you work from more than one device. Team licenses are for multiple people, not multiple machines.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use Pilot Shell on multiple projects?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Pilot Shell installs once globally and works across all your projects \u2014 you don\u2019t need to reinstall per project. All tools, rules, commands, and hooks live in ~/.pilot/ and ~/.claude/, available everywhere. Just cd into any project and run pilot. Each project can optionally have its own .claude/ rules, custom skills, and MCP servers for project-specific behavior. Run /setup-rules in each project to generate project-specific documentation and standards.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I add my own rules, commands, skills, and agents?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Create your own in your project\u2019s .claude/ folder \u2014 rules, commands, skills, and agents are all plain markdown files. Your project-level assets load alongside Pilot Shell\u2019s built-in defaults and take precedence when they overlap. /setup-rules auto-discovers your codebase patterns and generates project-specific rules. /create-skill builds reusable skills from any topic interactively. View and manage all extensions on the Console Extensions page. Team plan users can also share extensions via a connected git repository \u2014 push, pull, and compare versions with your team.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does Pilot Shell send my code or data to external services?",
    answer:
      "No code, files, prompts, project data, or personal information ever leaves your machine through Pilot Shell. All development tools \u2014 vector search, persistent memory, session state, and quality hooks \u2014 run entirely locally. Pilot Shell makes exactly three external calls, all for licensing only: (1) License validation \u2014 once every 24 hours, sends your license key and organization ID to api.polar.sh. (2) License activation \u2014 one-time, sends license key and a machine fingerprint to api.polar.sh. (3) Trial start \u2014 one-time, sends a hashed hardware fingerprint to pilot-shell.com to generate a 7-day trial key. That\u2019s the complete list. No OS info, no version strings, no analytics, no telemetry, no heartbeats. The validation result is cached locally, and Pilot Shell works fully offline for up to 7 days. If you enable the optional Codex plugin, adversarial reviews are sent to OpenAI\u2019s API \u2014 this is opt-in and disabled by default.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use Pilot Shell inside a Dev Container?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Copy the .devcontainer folder from the Pilot Shell repository into your project, adapt it to your needs (base image, extensions, dependencies), and install Pilot Shell inside the container. Everything works the same \u2014 hooks, rules, MCP servers, persistent memory, and the Console dashboard all run inside the container. This is a great option for teams that want a consistent, reproducible development environment.",
