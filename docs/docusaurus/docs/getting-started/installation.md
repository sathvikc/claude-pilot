# Installation

Works with any existing project — no scaffolding required.

## One-Command Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxritter/pilot-shell/main/install.sh | bash
```

Run from any directory — it installs globally to `~/.pilot/` and `~/.claude/`. After installation, `cd` into any project and run `pilot` or `ccp` to start.

## What the Installer Does

7 steps with progress tracking and rollback on failure:

| Step | Title | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Prerequisites | Checks/installs Homebrew, Node.js, Python 3.12+, uv, git, jq |
| 2 | Claude files | Sets up `~/.claude/` plugin — rules, commands, hooks, MCP servers |
| 3 | Config files | Creates `.nvmrc` and project config |
| 4 | Dependencies | Installs Probe, RTK, CodeGraph, playwright-cli, agent-browser, language servers |
| 5 | Shell integration | Auto-configures bash, fish, and zsh with the `pilot` alias |
| 6 | VS Code extensions | Installs recommended extensions for your language stack |
| 7 | Finalize | Success message with next steps |

## Chrome Extension (Recommended)

For the best browser automation and E2E testing experience, install the [Claude Code Chrome extension](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/chrome). It provides richer visual context and direct access to your existing browser sessions.

Pilot uses a 3-tier browser tool selection: **Chrome extension** (preferred) → **playwright-cli** (thorough E2E with persistent sessions, tracing, network mocking) → **agent-browser** (lightweight, fast startup). All three are installed automatically. In environments where Chrome can't be installed (dev containers, headless CI), Pilot falls back to the CLI tools automatically.

## Codex Plugin (Optional)

For adversarial code review powered by OpenAI Codex, install the [Codex plugin](https://github.com/openai/codex-plugin-cc):

```bash
claude plugin install @openai/codex
```

After installation, run `/codex:setup` and enable the Codex reviewers in Console Settings → Spec Workflow → Codex Reviewers. Pilot auto-detects the plugin — when enabled, Codex provides an independent second opinion during `/spec` planning and verification phases. A [ChatGPT Plus](https://chatgpt.com/#pricing) subscription ($20/mo) covers the Codex API usage needed for code reviews.

## Dev Container

Pilot Shell works inside Dev Containers. Copy the `.devcontainer` folder from the [Pilot Shell repository](https://github.com/maxritter/pilot-shell/tree/main/.devcontainer) into your project, adapt it to your needs (base image, extensions, dependencies), and run the installer inside the container. The installer auto-detects the container environment and skips system-level dependencies like Homebrew.

## Install Specific Version

```bash
export VERSION=7.5.7
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxritter/pilot-shell/main/install.sh | bash
```

See [releases](https://github.com/maxritter/pilot-shell/releases) for all available versions. Useful when a specific version is known stable.

## Uninstall

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxritter/pilot-shell/main/uninstall.sh | bash
```

Removes binary, plugin files, managed commands/rules, settings, and shell aliases. Your project's custom `.claude/` files are preserved.
