# Pilot Console

Local web dashboard at `localhost:41777` — monitor and manage your sessions.

The Console runs locally as a Bun/Express server with a React web UI. It starts when you launch Pilot and stops when all sessions close. All data — memories, sessions, usage — lives in a local SQLite database. Nothing leaves your machine.

```bash
$ open http://localhost:41777
```

:::tip Custom port
The default port `41777` is configurable. Open the **Settings** tab and edit the **Console → Worker Port** field, then click **Save Port** (or edit `CLAUDE_PILOT_WORKER_PORT` in `~/.pilot/memory/settings.json` directly). Restart Pilot for the change to take effect — the launcher, status line, hooks (session_end, pre_compact, dashboard notifications), MCP server, and installer all read the same setting and will follow it.

## Views

Each view that supports project filtering has an inline **Project Filter** dropdown next to the title. The **Dashboard** shows stats across all projects with clickable tiles that navigate to the relevant view.

| View | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Dashboard** | Global command center — 8 clickable stat cards (Projects, Sessions, Active, Memories, Extensions, Requirements, Specifications, Changes), 4 recent-item cards with "Show all" links, active specs as pills in the top bar, notification bell in the top right. |
| **Sessions** | Browse past sessions with search. Copy a session ID and run `/resume <session-id>` to jump back in — all context, files, and conversation history restored. |
| **Memories** | Observations (decisions, discoveries, bugfixes) with type filters and search. Each memory links back to the session it came from. |
| **Requirements** | PRD documents with view/annotate modes. Selected opens as a tab, others live in a Previous dropdown. |
| **Specifications** | Spec plans with task progress, phase tracking (PENDING/COMPLETE/VERIFIED), and iteration history. Hosts Plan Annotation and Spec Sharing (below). |
| **Extensions** | All extensions — local, plugin, remote — with team sharing via git (push, pull, diff), color-coded categories, and scope filtering. |
| **Changes** | Git diff viewer with staged/unstaged files, branch info, worktree context. Hosts Code Review and Spec Task Correlation (below). |
| **Usage** | Daily token costs, model routing breakdown (Opus vs Sonnet), and usage trends. |
| **Help** | Embedded pilot-shell.com documentation — full technical reference without leaving the Console. |
| **Settings** | Model selection, spec workflow toggles, reviewer toggles, extended context toggle, security scanner toggle. See [Settings](#settings) below. |

## Plan Annotation

When a spec plan is in the planning phase (PENDING, not yet approved), the Specifications tab auto-opens in **Annotate mode**. Toggle between View and Annotate using the control next to the "Specifications" heading.

Select any passage and write a free-text note in the popover that appears — no type selection, no submit button. Annotations save immediately and appear in the sidebar panel, where you can edit or delete them.

When the agent reaches the approval checkpoint, it reads your annotations directly from the Console, incorporates every note into the plan, and asks for approval again. Just write your notes and say "ready" when done.

## Code Review

After a spec completes automated verification, the agent prompts you to review the code changes. Switch to the **Changes** tab and enable **Review mode** using the toggle next to the "Changes" heading.

In Review mode, a **+** button appears on hover for every diff line. Click it to open an inline annotation form — write your note and press Save. Annotations appear in a panel at the bottom of the diff viewer.

The agent reads your code-review annotations directly from the Console before marking the spec verified. Say "fix" to have it address them, "approve" to mark the spec as verified. Annotations persist across page reloads, so you can review asynchronously while the agent runs verification in the background.

## Spec Task Correlation

When a `/spec` task is active, the Changes tab correlates each changed file with the spec task that touched it — instant traceability.

- Each file in the file list shows a **T{N}** badge (e.g., `T1`, `T3`) linking it to the matching spec task
- Hover the badge for the full task name
- Click the **Spec** button to switch to **group-by-spec** view — files organized by spec name and task number
- Correlation is parsed from the `**Files:**` section of each task, so any spec following the standard format works automatically

Especially useful for multi-task specs: instead of scrolling a flat file list, review changes task by task.

## Spec Sharing

Share specs with teammates for collaborative review — no cloud service required. Everything works locally with compressed URLs.

**Share:**

1. Open a spec, click **Share with Teammate** in the metadata row
2. A share URL is generated — the spec content and your annotations are compressed into the URL fragment (per the HTTP spec, fragments are never sent to any server)
3. Copy the URL and send it via Slack, email, or any channel
4. The **Receive Feedback** dialog opens automatically so you're ready for their response

**Review a shared spec:**

1. Your colleague opens the URL in their Pilot Console
2. They see your spec and annotations as read-only highlights
3. They add their own feedback via text selection or the **+** button on any block
4. Click **Send Feedback** to generate a feedback URL

**Import feedback:**

1. Click **Receive Feedback** on the original spec
2. Paste the URL — a preview shows the incoming annotations
3. **Accept** or **Reject** each annotation individually, or use **Accept All** / **Reject All**

Importing the same feedback twice is safe — annotations matching existing ones are skipped. For specs larger than ~32KB compressed, an embedded paste service stores the data locally in `~/.pilot/share/` with 3-day auto-expiry.

:::tip Both annotation methods work everywhere
The **+** button and text selection both work on the normal review page and on shared feedback pages. The **+** button is more reliable for quick block-level comments.

## Notifications

The Console sends real-time alerts via Server-Sent Events when Claude needs your input or a significant phase completes — no need to watch the terminal.

- Plan requires your approval — review and respond
- Spec phase completed — implementation done, verification starting
- Clarification needed — Claude is waiting for design decisions
- Session ended — completion summary with observation count

## Settings

The Settings tab (`localhost:41777/#/settings`, or your custom port) controls Pilot Shell behavior. Model preferences, spec workflow toggles, and reviewer agents save to `~/.pilot/config.json`. The **Console → Worker Port** field saves to `~/.pilot/memory/settings.json` and lets you move the Console off `41777` if it conflicts with another service. Both changes take effect after restarting Pilot.

### Model preferences

Choose between **Sonnet 4.6** ($3/$15 per MTok) and **Opus 4.7** ($5/$25 per MTok) independently per component.

| Component | Default | Scope |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Main Session** | Opus | Quick mode and direct chat |
| **Planning** | Opus | Codebase exploration, architecture design, plan writing |
| **Implementation** | Sonnet | TDD loop — write test, write code, verify |
| **Verification** | Sonnet | Test execution, code review orchestration |

**Custom model IDs** — each dropdown also offers a **Custom…** option. Selecting it reveals a text input where you can pin an explicit Anthropic model ID such as `claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-opus-4-5`, or `claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929`. Useful for reproducibility, team standardization, or falling back to an older model when a newer release mis-triggers content filters on legitimate code. The value is passed through to Claude Code verbatim. Custom IDs may carry the `[1m]` suffix (e.g. `claude-opus-4-7[1m]`) — the per-row 1M checkbox is disabled for Custom rows because the ID itself encodes the context window.

**Extended Context (1M):** the global toggle is the **default** for every row in the Model Preferences table that doesn't carry a per-row override. Each main-and-skill row also has a **per-row 1M checkbox**, so you can mix freely — e.g. *Opus 1M for planning, Sonnet 200K for implementation/verification* on Max plan without API billing. The toggle only applies to the `sonnet` and `opus` aliases; Custom rows are greyed out (their suffix encodes the context window).

API subscribers (Team, Enterprise) get 1M at no additional cost with all models. Max plan users must use Opus for any row that wants 1M — Sonnet 1M is not included in the Max plan.

**Per-row overrides on disk** — overrides are stored in the `extendedContextOverrides` map (see config example below). Keys are `main` or skill names (e.g. `spec-plan`, `spec-implement`). A missing key falls back to the global `extendedContext` flag. An empty map preserves pre-#139 behaviour exactly.

### Review agents

Two Claude sub-agents run in separate context windows during `/spec`. Each has its own model selector; disabling an agent skips it entirely.

| Agent | Default | Role |
|-------|---------|------|
| **Spec Review** | On | Validates plans before implementation. Checks alignment with requirements, flags risky assumptions. |
| **Changes Review** | On | Reviews code after implementation. Checks compliance, security, test coverage, goal achievement. |

**Codex adversarial reviewers (optional)** — OpenAI Codex agents that provide an independent second opinion.

| Agent | Default | Role |
|-------|---------|------|
| **Codex Spec Review** | Off | Adversarial plan review — second opinion before implementation. |
| **Codex Changes Review** | Off | Adversarial code review — second opinion after implementation. |

### Automation toggles

Three toggles control user interaction points during `/spec`. Disable all three for fully autonomous end-to-end execution.

| Toggle | Default | Enabled | Disabled |
|--------|---------|---------|----------|
| **Worktree Support** | On | Asks how to handle branching at `/spec` start | Skips the branch question — changes go on the current branch |
| **Ask Questions** | On | Asks clarifying questions during planning | Planning makes autonomous default choices |
| **Plan Approval** | On | Requires your approval before implementation starts | Implementation begins automatically after planning |

With all three off, `/spec add user authentication` plans, implements, and verifies the feature end-to-end without checkpoints.

:::warning Token usage in autonomous mode
No checkpoints means Claude executes the entire workflow without asking. Make sure your prompt is specific enough to avoid misinterpretation. You can always interrupt with Escape.
:::

### Security

| Toggle | Default | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| **Credential Scanner** | On | Scans prompts, file reads, Bash commands, command output, and `git commit` staged diffs for 24 secret patterns (AWS, GitHub, Stripe, OpenAI, Anthropic, JWT, etc.). Also denies any `.env*` file read unconditionally. Bypass per-prompt with `[allow-secret]`. |

The toggle persists to `securityScanner.credentialScanner` in `~/.pilot/config.json` and the launcher exports `PILOT_CREDENTIAL_SCANNER_ENABLED` so the four hook entry points respect it. Restart Pilot after toggling. See the [Security Scanner](./security.md) page for the full pattern list, scan-event matrix, and allow-tag semantics.

### Config file

All settings are stored in `~/.pilot/config.json`:

```json
{
  "model": "opus",
  "extendedContext": true,
  "extendedContextOverrides": {
    "spec-plan": true,
    "spec-implement": false
  },
  "skills": {
    "spec-plan": "opus",
    "spec-implement": "sonnet",
    "spec-verify": "sonnet",
    "spec": "sonnet",
    "setup-rules": "opus",
    "create-skill": "opus"
  },
  "agents": {
    "spec-review": "sonnet",
    "changes-review": "sonnet"
  },
  "reviewerAgents": {
    "specReview": true,
    "changesReview": true
  },
  "codexReviewers": {
    "specReview": false,
    "changesReview": false
  },
  "specWorkflow": {
    "branchIsolation": true,
    "askQuestionsDuringPlanning": true,
    "planApproval": true
  },
  "securityScanner": {
    "credentialScanner": true
  }
}
```

`extendedContextOverrides` is keyed by the skill's filesystem name (e.g. `spec-plan`); the launcher also accepts the resolved alias (e.g. `spec-bugfix-plan` → `spec-plan`) on lookup miss for forward-compat. Omit the key to inherit the global `extendedContext` default. Agents intentionally cannot opt into 1M — sub-agents do not support extended context.

You can edit this file directly — the Settings UI is a convenience wrapper. Changes require a Claude Code restart.
