# MCP Servers

External context always available to every session.

Seven MCP servers are pre-configured and lazy-loaded to keep context lean.

- **Claude Code:** configured in `~/.claude.json` (merged from `.mcp.json` during install). Add custom servers in `.mcp.json`.
- **Codex:** configured in `~/.codex/config.toml` under `[mcp_servers.*]`.

Run `/setup-rules` (or `$setup-rules`) to generate documentation for your custom MCP servers. Pilot also installs the `chrome-devtools-mcp` plugin for browser automation.

## chrome-devtools-mcp plugin

**Browser automation via Chrome DevTools Protocol**

Enterprise-friendly fallback when the Claude Code Chrome extension can't be installed. Connects directly to Chrome via CDP — no extension needed. Also provides Lighthouse audits, performance tracing, and device emulation that other browser tools lack. Integrated via [chrome-devtools-mcp](https://github.com/ChromeDevTools/chrome-devtools-mcp).

```
list_pages()
navigate_page(type="url", url="http://localhost:3000")
take_snapshot()  // a11y tree with uid refs
click(uid="1_8")
lighthouse_audit(device="desktop")
performance_start_trace(autoStop=true, reload=true)
```

**Key capabilities:**

| Tool | Use case |
|------|----------|
| `take_snapshot` | A11y tree with uid refs for clicking, filling, hovering |
| `take_screenshot` | Visual capture of viewport or specific element |
| `evaluate_script` | Run JavaScript in the page context |
| `lighthouse_audit` | Accessibility, SEO, and best practices scores |
| `performance_start_trace` | Core Web Vitals (LCP, CLS), performance insights |
| `emulate` | Device viewport, mobile/touch, color scheme, CPU throttling |
| `list_network_requests` | Inspect all network traffic with headers and bodies |
| `list_console_messages` | Read console output filtered by type (error, warn, log) |

**4-tier browser priority (Claude Code):** Claude Code Chrome extension → Chrome DevTools MCP → playwright-cli → agent-browser. On Codex, the Chrome extension is not available — Chrome DevTools MCP is the preferred tool.

## context7

**Library documentation lookup**

Get up-to-date API docs and code examples for any library or framework. Two-step: resolve the library ID, then query for specific documentation.

```
resolve-library-id(libraryName="react")
query-docs(libraryId="/npm/react", query="useEffect cleanup")
```

## mem-search

**Persistent memory search**

Recall decisions, discoveries, and context from past sessions. Three-layer workflow: search → timeline → get_observations for token efficiency.

```
search(query="authentication flow", limit=5)
timeline(anchor=22865, depth_before=3)
get_observations(ids=[22865, 22866])
```

## web-search

**Web search + article fetching**

Web search via DuckDuckGo, Bing, and Exa (no API keys needed). Also fetches GitHub READMEs, Linux.do articles, and other content sources.

```
search(query="React Server Components 2026", limit=5)
fetchGithubReadme(url="https://github.com/org/repo")
```

## grep-mcp

**GitHub code search**

Find real-world code examples from 1M+ public repositories. Search by literal code patterns, filter by language, repo, or file path. Supports regex.

```
searchGitHub(query="useServerAction", language=["TypeScript"])
searchGitHub(query="FastMCP", language=["Python"])
```

## web-fetch

**Full web page fetching**

Fetch complete web pages via Playwright (handles JS-rendered content, no truncation). Fetches single or multiple URLs in one call.

```
fetch_url(url="https://docs.example.com/api")
fetch_urls(urls=["https://a.com", "https://b.com"])
```

## CodeGraph

**Code knowledge graph and structural analysis**

Builds a semantic knowledge graph of your codebase — functions, classes, call chains, and dependencies. Complements Semble: Semble finds code by intent ("how does auth work?"), CodeGraph finds by structure ("who calls this function?", "what's affected by changing this?").

```
codegraph_search(query="Handler", kind="function")
codegraph_callers(symbol="processOrder")
codegraph_callees(symbol="processOrder")
codegraph_impact(symbol="processOrder", depth=2)
codegraph_context(task="refactor authentication flow")
```

**Key capabilities:**

| Tool | Use case |
|------|----------|
| `codegraph_search` | Find symbols by name — functions, classes, types |
| `codegraph_callers` | Who calls X? Complete caller list with file locations |
| `codegraph_callees` | What does X call? All downstream dependencies |
| `codegraph_impact` | Blast radius — transitive callers and callees affected by a change |
| `codegraph_context` | Task-driven context retrieval — entry points, related symbols, and code |
| `codegraph_node` | Get details and source code for a specific symbol |

**When to use CodeGraph vs Semble:**

CodeGraph and Semble are **co-primary** — each excels at different query types.

| Question | Best tool |
|----------|-----------|
| "Who calls this function?" | **CodeGraph** — `codegraph_callers` with exact caller list |
| "What's the blast radius of my changes?" | **CodeGraph** — `codegraph_impact` shows transitive affected symbols |
| "Find functions matching a name" | **CodeGraph** — `codegraph_search` with kind filter |
| "Get context for a task" | **CodeGraph** — `codegraph_context` returns entry points and related code |
| "Get details and source for one symbol" | **CodeGraph** — `codegraph_node` (Semble does not extract by symbol name) |
| "How does authentication work?" | **Semble** — natural-language hybrid search (BM25 + Model2Vec) |
| "Where does settings.json get modified?" | **Semble** — finds mutation sites across languages, not just type definitions |
| "How does the notification system work?" | **Semble** — surfaces the full feature stack (UI hooks, routes, business logic) |
| "Find code similar to a specific location" | **Semble** — `find_related` discovers parallel implementations |

:::info Tool selection
`codegraph_context` first for structural orientation, then Semble for intent-based discovery. context7 for library API lookups, grep-mcp for production code examples, web-search for current information.

On Claude Code, the `tool_redirect.py` hook blocks the built-in WebSearch/WebFetch and redirects to these MCP alternatives automatically.

## Semble

**Hybrid code search — semantic embeddings + BM25 lexical**

Indexes any repo (local path or git URL) in ~250 ms and answers natural-language or symbol queries in ~1.5 ms — all on CPU. Combines [Model2Vec](https://github.com/MinishLab/model2vec) static code embeddings (`potion-code-16M`) with BM25 lexical scoring, fused via Reciprocal Rank Fusion. Code-aware chunking via [Chonkie](https://github.com/chonkie-inc/chonkie), with definition boosts, identifier stem matching, and noise penalties (test/legacy/example down-ranked). Auto-reindexes on file change for local paths. Integrated via [Semble](https://github.com/MinishLab/semble).

```text
mcp__semble__search(query="authentication flow", repo="/abs/path")
mcp__semble__search(query="save_pretrained", top_k=10)        // symbol-style
mcp__semble__find_related(file_path="src/auth.ts", line=42, repo="/abs/path")
```

**Key capabilities:**

| Tool | Use case |
|------|----------|
| `search` | Natural-language or symbol search with hybrid (default), `semantic`, or `bm25` modes |
| `find_related` | Find code semantically similar to a specific `file:line` — discovers parallel implementations and call sites |

**Token efficiency.** Semble returns only the matched chunks — Semble's own benchmark shows ~98% fewer tokens than `grep + read` at 94% recall. Per-call savings are recorded to `~/.semble/savings.jsonl`. RTK output-compression savings are shown in the Console "Usage" tab (as a share of would-be I/O tokens, per day/week/month).

**Also available as a CLI** (`semble search`, `semble find-related`, `semble savings`) — see the rules doc for the full reference.
