# MCP Servers

External context always available to every session.

Six MCP servers are pre-configured and always available. They're lazy-loaded via `ToolSearch` to keep context lean — discovered and called on demand. Add your own in `.mcp.json`, then run `/setup-rules` to generate documentation.

## context7

**Library documentation lookup**

Get up-to-date API docs and code examples for any library or framework. Two-step: resolve the library ID, then query for specific documentation.

```
resolve-library-id(libraryName="react")
query-docs(libraryId="/npm/react", query="useEffect cleanup")
```

## mem-search

**Persistent memory search**

Recall decisions, discoveries, and context from past sessions. Three-layer workflow: search → timeline → get_observations for token efficiency.

```
search(query="authentication flow", limit=5)
timeline(anchor=22865, depth_before=3)
get_observations(ids=[22865, 22866])
```

## web-search

**Web search + article fetching**

Web search via DuckDuckGo, Bing, and Exa (no API keys needed). Also fetches GitHub READMEs, Linux.do articles, and other content sources.

```
search(query="React Server Components 2026", limit=5)
fetchGithubReadme(url="https://github.com/org/repo")
```

## grep-mcp

**GitHub code search**

Find real-world code examples from 1M+ public repositories. Search by literal code patterns, filter by language, repo, or file path. Supports regex.

```
searchGitHub(query="useServerAction", language=["TypeScript"])
searchGitHub(query="FastMCP", language=["Python"])
```

## web-fetch

**Full web page fetching**

Fetch complete web pages via Playwright (handles JS-rendered content, no truncation). Fetches single or multiple URLs in one call.

```
fetch_url(url="https://docs.example.com/api")
fetch_urls(urls=["https://a.com", "https://b.com"])
```

## CodeGraph

**Code knowledge graph and structural analysis**

Builds a semantic knowledge graph of your codebase — functions, classes, call chains, and dependencies. Complements Probe CLI: Probe finds code by intent ("how does auth work?"), CodeGraph finds by structure ("who calls this function?", "what's affected by changing this?").

```
codegraph_search(query="Handler", kind="function")
codegraph_callers(symbol="processOrder")
codegraph_callees(symbol="processOrder")
codegraph_impact(symbol="processOrder", depth=2)
codegraph_context(task="refactor authentication flow")
```

**Key capabilities:**

| Tool | Use case |
|------|----------|
| `codegraph_search` | Find symbols by name — functions, classes, types |
| `codegraph_callers` | Who calls X? Complete caller list with file locations |
| `codegraph_callees` | What does X call? All downstream dependencies |
| `codegraph_impact` | Blast radius — transitive callers and callees affected by a change |
| `codegraph_context` | Task-driven context retrieval — entry points, related symbols, and code |
| `codegraph_node` | Get details and source code for a specific symbol |

**When to use Probe vs CodeGraph:**

| Question | Best tool |
|----------|-----------|
| "How does authentication work?" | **Probe** — natural language, intent-based search |
| "Who calls this function?" | **CodeGraph** — `codegraph_callers` with exact caller list |
| "What's the blast radius of my changes?" | **CodeGraph** — `codegraph_impact` shows transitive affected symbols |
| "Find functions matching a name" | **CodeGraph** — `codegraph_search` with kind filter |
| "Get context for a task" | **CodeGraph** — `codegraph_context` returns entry points and related code |
| "Extract a specific function's source" | **Both** — Probe `extract` for line/symbol, CodeGraph `codegraph_node` for symbol details |

:::info Tool selection
Rules specify the preferred order — Probe CLI first for intent-based codebase questions, CodeGraph for structural queries (call tracing, impact analysis), context7 for library API lookups, grep-mcp for production code examples, web-search for current information. The `tool_redirect.py` hook blocks the built-in WebSearch/WebFetch and the Explore agent, redirecting to these alternatives.
