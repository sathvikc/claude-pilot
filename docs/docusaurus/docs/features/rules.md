# Rules & Standards

Production-tested best practices loaded into every session.

Rules load automatically at session start — enforced standards, not suggestions. Pilot ships 10 built-in rules plus 7 coding standards activated by file type.

- **Claude Code:** rules in `~/.claude/rules/` (global) and `.claude/rules/` (project). Project rules take precedence.
- **Codex:** rules delivered via `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`, adapted from the same source. Custom rules work the same way.

Run `/setup-rules` (or `$setup-rules` on Codex) to generate project-specific rules from your codebase.

## Built-in Rule Categories

### Core Workflow (3 rules)

- `task-and-workflow.md` — Task management, /spec orchestration, deviation handling
- `testing.md` — TDD workflow with `Trivial:` escape, parsimony-first test design (reuse existing tests; max 1 unit + 1 functional test class when new coverage is needed), critical-path coverage review
- `verification.md` — Execution verification, completion requirements

### Development Practices (4 rules)

- `development-practices.md` — Project policies, systematic debugging, git rules
- `code-review-reception.md` — How to receive and act on code review feedback
- `documentation-sync.md` — Update affected docs (README, API docs, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md) in the same change as the code
- `response-shape.md` — Answer first, numbered steps, state restated each turn, no preamble or closers — without compressing away verification evidence ([see below](#response-shape-answer-first))

### Tooling & Context (3 rules)

- `cli-tools.md` — Pilot CLI, Semble hybrid code search, RTK token optimization
- `browser-automation.md` — Browser automation for E2E UI testing (Chrome → Chrome DevTools MCP → playwright-cli → agent-browser), plus an optional advisory [impeccable](https://impeccable.style) design anti-pattern check (`impeccable detect`, deterministic, no API key) on changed UI
- `mcp-servers.md` — MCP server reference and tool selection guidance

## Coding Standards — Activated by File Type

| Standard | Activates On | Coverage |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Python | `*.py` | uv, pytest, ruff, basedpyright, type hints |
| TypeScript | `*.ts, *.tsx, *.js, *.jsx` | npm/pnpm, Jest, ESLint, Prettier, React patterns |
| Go | `*.go` | Modules, testing, formatting, error handling |
| .NET | `*.cs, *.csproj, *.sln` | dotnet CLI, format gate, nullable, analyzers, test traits |
| Frontend | `*.tsx, *.jsx, *.html, *.vue, *.css` | Components, CSS, accessibility, responsive design |
| Blazor | `*.razor, *.razor.css, *.razor.cs` | Components, CSS isolation, render modes, lifecycle |
| Backend | `**/models/**, **/routes/**, **/api/**` | API design, data models, query optimization, migrations |

:::tip Custom rules
Create `.claude/rules/my-rule.md` in your project. Add `paths: ["*.py"]` frontmatter to activate only for specific file types. Run `/setup-rules` to auto-discover patterns and generate project-specific rules.
:::

:::info Monorepo support
Organize rules in nested subdirectories by product and team (e.g. `.claude/rules/my-product/team-x/`). Team-level rules must use `paths` frontmatter to scope to the right files. `/setup-rules` generates a `README.md` in your rules directory to document the structure.

## Response shape: answer first

The `response-shape.md` rule governs how the agent talks to you, not what it builds. Ten rules, enforced every turn:

1. **Lead with the action or result** — the command, path, finding, or "done, here's what now works." Never a plan to do it.
2. **Number multi-step work** — one bounded action per step.
3. **End with one concrete next action** — only when something is genuinely left for you. Nothing pending, no closer.
4. **Suppress tangents** — a second issue is offered as a separate question, never inlined.
5. **Restate state each turn** — "Task 3/5 done: schema updated. Next: backfill `users.tier`."
6. **Concrete estimates** — minutes and files, never "a bit of work."
7. **Wins in terms of what works** — "Magic-link login works. Try `npm run dev`, open `/login`," not "I've made some changes."
8. **Matter-of-fact errors** — cause and fix, no "Uh oh."
9. **Cap lists at five** — five ranked beats ten unranked.
10. **No preamble, no recap, no closers** — no "Great question," no "Hope this helps," no "You're absolutely right."

**Brevity never eats evidence.** Verification output, failed tests, skipped steps, risk callouts before destructive actions, and stated assumptions are explicitly exempt — `verification.md` outranks concision, and a clean-looking summary that hides a failure is a rule violation, not a win.

**Overrides are built in.** "Explain this" gets a full explanation; destructive actions get a confirmation; a third turn of "still broken" stops the code churn and asks a diagnostic question; and structured workflow output (`/spec` plans, verification reports, PRDs) keeps its own required format.

To use a different voice in one repo, create `.claude/rules/response-shape-project.md` — it shadows the global rule and can override just the sections you disagree with.

## Testing posture: parsimonious by default

The default `testing.md` rule defines the agent's testing posture. Pilot's default is **parsimonious**:

- **Reuse existing behavioural tests first.** When a new public production class truly needs new tests, the ceiling is 1 unit test class + 1 functional test class (only when behaviour cannot be covered through unit tests). One test class per production class is the ceiling, not the floor — splitting tests per-method or mirroring code structure in tests is an anti-pattern (per Uncle Bob's *Test Contravariance* and Kent Beck's *Test Desiderata* "structure-insensitive" property).
- **Coverage gate scoped to critical paths** (business logic, security, data integrity, error handling). No blanket numeric threshold on glue code, configuration plumbing, simple CRUD, or trivial UI bindings. Coverage padding to push a number above a threshold is an anti-pattern.
- **TDD with documented escapes.** Red-green-refactor remains the default. The `Trivial:` plan-task field is the documented opt-out for changes ≤ 5 net new lines with no new branch, public symbol, or error path, and it must name an existing covering test or verification command. Bugfixes never qualify — a reproducing RED test is the bugfix lane's anti-regression guarantee.
- **Post-implementation enforcement.** The changes review (built-in `/code-review` skill on Claude Code, native `changes-review` agent on Codex) and the `spec-verify` Step 5 audit ("Test Parsimony Audit" + "Trivial: claim audit") verify the doctrine against the actual diff — the planner's claim is not authoritative.

### Override the testing posture

If your project wants strict TDD on every change, blanket 80 % coverage, or a different posture, create `.claude/rules/testing-project.md` in the repository — it shadows Pilot's global `testing.md`. The shadow file can be as small as a few overriding sections (the rest of the global rule still applies). Suggested structure:

```markdown
---
paths: ["**/*.py", "**/*.ts", "**/*.tsx"]
---

## Testing override

This project requires:
- Strict TDD on every code change (no `Trivial:` escape).
- 80 % minimum coverage across the entire codebase, not just critical paths.
- One test class per production class is acceptable; do not consolidate.
```

See `pilot/rules/testing.md` § Default Posture for the full doctrine that the shadow file overrides.

### Anti-patterns the parsimony rule rejects

| Anti-pattern | Why it's rejected |
|--------------|-------------------|
| One test class per method (e.g. `DoSomethingTests` for `Foo.DoSomething()`) | Couples test layout to implementation detail; refactor moves a method, all tests break. Reviewer flags as `must_fix`. |
| Mirroring code structure in tests | Behaviour-preserving refactor must not break the suite; structure-insensitive is a Test Desideratum. Flagged as `suggestion`. |
| Redundant assertions on the same path | Three tests asserting the same observable behaviour through three internal paths is one test, not three. Maintenance tax with no signal. Flagged as `should_fix`. |
| Test-per-trivial-helper | A one-line getter/formatter with no branches and no public-API exposure is covered by the test for the function that uses it. |
| Coverage padding to hit a threshold | Numbers are a side-effect of testing what matters, not the goal. Threshold-driven test creation is rejected. |
| `Trivial:` justification used to skip TDD on a non-trivial change | Post-implementation `Trivial:` claim audit verifies the field names an existing covering check and that the diff meets the four criteria (≤ 5 production lines, no new branch with non-trivial body, no new public symbol, no new error path). Mismatch → `must_fix`, remove `Trivial:`, write a real RED test. |
