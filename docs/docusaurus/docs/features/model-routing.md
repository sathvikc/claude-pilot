# Model Routing

:::warning Claude Code only
Model Switching is a Claude Code feature. It is not available in Codex CLI -- on Codex, set the model via `codex --model <name>` or in `~/.codex/config.toml`, and `/spec` runs on whatever model is active.
:::

Opus reasons better; Sonnet is faster and cheaper. The cost-saving move is to plan on a stronger model, then drop to a cheaper one for the mechanical implementation and verification that follow. **Model Switching** controls how `/spec` handles that switch.

## The Three Modes

**Console -> Settings -> Model Switching** offers three mutually exclusive modes:

| Mode | What happens | Who switches |
|------|--------------|--------------|
| **Automated** (default) | `/spec` runs on the `opusplan` model: Opus 4.8 plans (plan mode), Sonnet 5 executes everything else | Claude Code, natively |
| **Manual** | `/spec` pauses once after plan approval so you can switch to your implementation model | You, via `/model` |
| **Off** | No model management, no prompts, no gates | Nobody -- the active `/model` choice runs everything |

Pilot does **not** remap model aliases behind the scenes in any mode -- your `/model` picker always means what it says.

## Manual

You stay in control of the model at every phase:

1. Type `/spec <task>` on whatever model you want planning to run on (the Step-0 message reminds you -- switch with `/model` before planning starts if needed). Fable 5, Opus 4.8, anything.
2. Plan, review, approve as usual.
3. After you approve the plan, `/spec` finishes its turn with a switch prompt: *"switch to your implementation model now via `/model`, then send `continue`."* You get the input box back, run `/model sonnet` (or keep the current model), confirm Claude Code's dialog about carrying the conversation over to the new model, and type `continue` — implementation starts on your choice.

That's the whole contract -- one reminder, one pause. In fully-autonomous runs (Plan Approval disabled), the pause is skipped and a one-line notice is printed instead.

## Automated (default)

`/spec` drives Claude Code's native `opusplan` model:

- Pilot sets `model: opusplan` (and the matching `ANTHROPIC_MODEL` env pin) in `~/.claude/settings.json` when you select Automated.
- The spec skills enter plan mode at planning start (Opus 4.8) and exit it after plan approval (Sonnet 5). Plan mode is purely the model lever here -- approval still happens at the AskUserQuestion gate.
- The `spec_mode_guard` hook blocks `/spec` when the session is not on `opusplan` and tells you to run `/model opusplan`.

**Know the boundary conditions.** Claude Code decides the plan-leg model, and it can silently keep serving Sonnet when Opus is not available for the request:

- **Conversation too large.** The Opus plan leg has an effective 200K window on accounts without Opus 1M (no 1M entitlement, or exhausted Max usage credits). Once your conversation is bigger than that, plan mode cannot move it to Opus. Pilot pre-flight-checks this at `/spec` submit and warns you to `/compact` / `/clear` first (or use Manual mode); a mid-planning check warns again if planning is observably not on Opus.
- **Opus usage limits.** Under `opusplan`, Claude Code serves Sonnet while your Opus pool is exhausted and switches back when it frees up (`/usage` shows the state).

## Off

Pilot stays out of model management entirely. `/spec`, `/fix`, and quick mode all run on the active `/model` choice with no reminders and no gates. Switching away from Automated heals a Pilot-written `opusplan` back to `opus[1m]`; any model you picked yourself -- including `opusplan` -- is left alone.

## Migration from earlier versions

The old boolean toggle (and the 9.12 configurable Plan/Execution model pair with its window-scoped alias pins) is gone:

| Old setting | New mode |
|-------------|----------|
| Model Switching ON (old default) | Automated |
| Model Switching OFF | Off |

Automated matches what ON-users were already getting; select Manual or Off in the Console if you'd rather. Any leftover alias remaps an older Pilot wrote into `~/.claude/settings.json` are cleaned up on the next Pilot start (values you set yourself are left alone).

## The env var

Skills and hooks read the mode fresh from `~/.pilot/config.json` (`specWorkflow.modelSwitchMode`), so a Console change applies to the very next `/spec` -- no session restart needed. `PILOT_MODEL_SWITCH_MODE` (`automated` | `manual` | `off`) is exported for display and subagents.
