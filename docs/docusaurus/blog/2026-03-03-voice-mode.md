Claude Code voice mode lets you hold spacebar to talk, release to transcribe. Mix typed and spoken input in a single prompt.

<!-- truncate -->

**Problem**: You're staring at a complex bug, and you know exactly what you want Claude to do. But translating that mental model into a typed prompt takes longer than it should. You end up simplifying your request because typing out all the context, the nuances, the "try this but not that" qualifiers, feels like writing a mini-essay. The gap between what you're thinking and what you type costs you clarity and time.

**Quick Win**: Type `/voice` to enable voice mode. Hold spacebar, talk through your thought process, release spacebar. Your spoken words stream in as text at the cursor position. You can type half a prompt, voice the messy middle, and keep typing. No mode switching. No lost context.

```
# Enable voice mode
/voice
 
# Then hold spacebar to talk, release to send
# Your transcript appears at cursor position
```

Claude Code voice mode is rolling out now, starting with roughly 5% of users and expanding over the coming weeks. It's available on Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans. If you have access, you'll see a welcome screen note the next time you launch Claude Code. If you're new to working in the terminal, start with the terminal-first development model to understand how Claude Code's execution model works.

## How Claude Code Voice Mode Works

Voice mode in Claude Code uses push-to-talk. There's no always-listening mode, no wake word, no ambient transcription. You control exactly when the microphone is active.

The mechanics are straightforward:

| Action | What Happens |
| --- | --- |
| `/voice` | Toggles voice mode on or off |
| Hold spacebar | Microphone activates, starts listening |
| Release spacebar | Transcription processes and text appears at cursor |
| Keep typing | Text and voice input combine in the same prompt |

When you release the spacebar, your spoken words get transcribed and inserted at wherever your cursor is positioned in the input. This is important: voice doesn't replace your current input. It inserts into it. So if you've typed the first half of a prompt and want to voice the rest, just hold spacebar and talk. The transcription drops right after your typed text.

The transcription happens quickly enough to feel like a natural extension of typing. You talk, release, and the text is there. No separate UI, no popup, no confirmation dialog.

### Transcription and Rate Limits

A practical detail worth knowing: transcription tokens don't count against your rate limits. Voice mode doesn't cost extra on any plan. The transcription processing happens separately from the model tokens you use for Claude's responses. This means you can voice-input lengthy, detailed prompts without worrying about burning through your usage quota faster.

## Hybrid Input: The Feature That Actually Matters

The headline feature of voice mode isn't voice itself. It's the ability to mix typed and spoken input in a single prompt without either one interrupting the other.

Here's what that looks like in practice:

```
[Type]: "Refactor the auth middleware in src/middleware/auth.ts to "
[Voice]: "handle the edge case where the JWT token is expired but
         the refresh token is still valid, and make sure we're not
         hitting the database twice during that flow"
[Type]: " -- keep the existing error codes"
```

That entire sequence produces one prompt. The typed portions give you precision for file paths, variable names, and specific constraints. The voiced portion lets you stream out the complex logic without stopping to think about how to structure the sentence.

This hybrid approach solves a real problem. When you're [engineering context for Claude](/blog/context-engineering), you often need to convey both precise technical details and fuzzy intent in the same message. Typing is better for the precise parts. Talking is better for the fuzzy parts. Now you don't have to choose.

### When Hybrid Input Shines

**Describing bugs you can see but struggle to type**: "The dropdown renders correctly on first load but [voice] when you navigate away and come back the state resets and the selected item reverts to the default even though the URL params still have the right value [/voice] -- check useEffect cleanup in FilterPanel.tsx"

**Explaining architecture decisions**: Type the file paths and function names, voice the reasoning behind why you want a specific approach. The technical specifics stay precise. The reasoning flows naturally.

**Dictating test scenarios**: Type the test framework boilerplate, voice the edge cases you want covered. "It should also handle [voice] the case where the user has multiple sessions open and submits the form from a stale tab after their session has been refreshed in another tab [/voice]"

## Practical Use Cases for Voice Mode

Voice mode fits specific workflows better than others. These are the situations where talking genuinely beats typing.

### Rapid Prototyping Sessions

When you're iterating fast and switching between ideas, typing forces you to commit to a structure before you've finished thinking. Voice lets you talk through the approach while it's still forming. "Try building this as a React component first, but if the state management gets complicated, switch to a vanilla JS approach with a simple pub-sub pattern." That kind of exploratory instruction comes out faster spoken than typed.

### Long-Context Bug Reports

If you're debugging something and need to give Claude the full picture, voice mode lets you narrate what you're seeing, what you've tried, and what you suspect, all in one breath. Combined with planning mode for the analysis phase, you can voice-dictate a thorough bug description and have Claude plan the fix before any code changes happen.

### Code Review Feedback

When reviewing diffs and you want Claude to address specific issues: type the file path, voice your feedback. "In this function [voice] the error handling is swallowing exceptions silently and I want every catch block to at least log the error with the request context before continuing [/voice] -- apply this across all route handlers."

### Accessibility

For developers who find extended typing uncomfortable or who work better verbally, voice mode makes Claude Code sessions less physically demanding. The push-to-talk approach means you control the pace, and you can switch between typing and talking based on what feels right for each part of the prompt.

## Current Limitations

Voice mode is brand new, and there are constraints worth knowing before you build it into your workflow.

**Rolling out gradually.** Only about 5% of users have access today. Anthropic is ramping availability over the coming weeks across Pro, Max, Team, and Enterprise plans. If you don't see the welcome screen or `/voice` doesn't work, you're not in the rollout group yet.

**Push-to-talk only.** There's no hands-free or always-listening mode. You hold spacebar to talk, release to stop. This is a deliberate design choice for a terminal environment where you don't want accidental voice input triggering transcription.

**No Agent SDK support.** If you're building programmatic workflows through the Claude Code SDK, voice mode isn't available there. It's a terminal-only interactive feature for now.

**English assumed.** While Anthropic hasn't explicitly confirmed language restrictions for the CLI voice feature, the initial rollout appears focused on English transcription.

### Voice Mode in Claude Code vs Claude.ai

It's worth noting that Claude also has a separate voice mode on the web and mobile apps at claude.ai. That's a different feature. The web/mobile version includes hands-free conversation mode, preset voice selection, and continuous back-and-forth dialogue. Claude Code's voice mode is specifically designed for the terminal: push-to-talk input that produces text, not a conversational voice interface. They solve different problems for different contexts.

## Tips for Effective Voice Input

**Be specific about file paths and names by typing them.** Voice transcription can mangle paths like `src/components/AuthProvider.tsx`. Type the precise bits, voice the instructions.

**Front-load the action.** Start your voiced input with what you want done, then add context. "Refactor this function to use async/await" is easier for Claude to parse than a two-minute stream-of-consciousness that ends with "so yeah, make it async."

**Combine with [fast mode](/blog/fast-mode) for rapid iteration.** Toggle fast mode for quicker responses, then use voice to fire off prompts without the typing overhead. The combination of faster output and faster input compresses the feedback loop significantly.

**Use voice for the "why" and typing for the "what."** Type: `update src/api/routes.ts`. Voice: "because the current error handling doesn't distinguish between auth failures and network timeouts, and downstream consumers need different retry behavior for each." This pattern gives Claude both precision and intent.

## Next Steps

- Browse the full [interactive mode reference](/blog/interactive-mode) for keyboard shortcuts, /btw side questions, vim mode, and every slash command
- Learn [context engineering](/blog/context-engineering) to structure effective prompts, whether typed or spoken
- Use planning mode alongside voice for complex analysis before implementation
- Explore [fast mode](/blog/fast-mode) to pair faster output with voice's faster input
- Read about the terminal-first development model that voice mode builds on
- Check the [/simplify and /batch commands](/blog/simplify-batch-commands) for more bundled workflows shipping in recent releases

Voice mode is the kind of feature that seems minor until you use it for a day and can't go back. The hybrid input model, where typed precision meets spoken fluency, matches how developers actually think about code. You don't think in pure text or pure speech. You think in a mix of specifics and intent. Now your terminal input can work the same way.
