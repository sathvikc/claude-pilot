Claude Code Review dispatches parallel agents to hunt bugs in every PR. Learn how it works, what it costs, and how to enable it for your team.

<!-- truncate -->

**Problem**: Human code reviewers skim PRs. They catch style issues and obvious mistakes, but subtle bugs slip through -- especially on large diffs where attention fades after the first few hundred lines.

Claude Code Review fixes this with automated AI code review that actually works. It dispatches a team of agents on every PR, searching for bugs in parallel, cross-verifying findings to cut false positives, ranking issues by severity, and delivering one high-signal summary comment plus inline flags on the exact lines that matter.

## How Claude Code Review Works

When a PR opens on a repository with Code Review enabled, the system kicks off automatically. No developer configuration needed. Here's what happens under the hood:

1. **Parallel agent dispatch** -- Multiple agents fan out across the diff simultaneously, each analyzing different sections and patterns
2. **Bug hunting** -- Agents look for logic errors, security issues, race conditions, type mismatches, and subtle edge cases that humans routinely miss
3. **Cross-verification** -- Agents check each other's findings to filter out false positives before anything gets posted
4. **Severity ranking** -- Confirmed issues get ranked by impact, so you see critical bugs first
5. **Output** -- One summary comment with the overall assessment, plus inline comments on specific lines

Reviews scale with PR complexity. A small PR under 50 lines gets a lightweight pass. A 1,000+ line refactor gets deeper analysis with more agents. Average review time is around 20 minutes.

### What Makes Claude Code Review Different from Linters

Static analysis tools catch known patterns. Code Review catches contextual bugs -- things that are syntactically correct but logically wrong. It understands what your code is trying to do, not just what rules it follows.

A real example from Anthropic's internal testing: a one-line production change would have silently broken authentication. No linter would flag it. Code Review caught it as critical before merge.

Another case from TrueNAS's open-source ZFS encryption refactor: Code Review surfaced a pre-existing type mismatch that was "silently wiping the encryption key cache on every sync." That's the kind of bug that lives in production for months before someone figures out why things are intermittently failing.

## Results from Internal Testing

Anthropic ran Code Review on their own PRs for months before launching. The numbers tell the story:

| Metric | Before | After |
| --- | --- | --- |
| PRs with substantive review comments | 16% | **54%** |
| Findings marked incorrect by engineers | -- | **Less than 1%** |
| Large PRs (1,000+ lines) with findings | -- | **84%** (avg 7.5 issues) |
| Small PRs (under 50 lines) with findings | -- | **31%** (avg 0.5 issues) |

The under-1% incorrect rate is what stands out. This isn't a noisy bot flooding your PRs with suggestions -- it's a focused system that only speaks up when it has something real to say.

## Pricing and Cost Controls

Code Review is billed on token usage. The cost scales with PR complexity:

- **Average review**: $15-25 per PR
- **Small PRs**: Lower end of the range
- **Large, complex PRs**: Higher end, more agents, deeper analysis

This is more expensive than the [open-source Claude Code GitHub Action](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action), which remains available for free. The tradeoff is depth -- Code Review optimizes for thoroughness over cost.

### Admin Controls

Admins get full spending visibility and controls:

- **Monthly organization spending caps** -- Set a ceiling and never exceed it
- **Repository-level enable/disable** -- Turn it on for critical repos, off for experimental ones
- **Analytics dashboard** -- Track PRs reviewed, acceptance rates, and total costs

## How to Enable Code Review

**Requirements**: Team or Enterprise plan. Not available on free or Pro.

**For admins:**

1. Go to Claude Code settings
2. Enable Code Review
3. Install the GitHub App
4. Select which repositories to monitor

**For developers:** Nothing. Once an admin enables it, reviews run automatically on every new PR. No individual setup or configuration needed.

## One Important Limitation

Code Review will not approve PRs. It finds bugs and flags them. A human still needs to review and approve before merge. This is a deliberate design choice -- AI should augment human review, not replace the approval step.

## Code Review vs the Open-Source GitHub Action

If you're already using the Claude Code GitHub Action, here's how Code Review compares:

| Feature | Code Review | GitHub Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Architecture | Multi-agent, parallel analysis | Single-pass, lighter weight |
| Depth | Optimized for thoroughness | Standard analysis |
| False positive rate | Under 1% (cross-verification) | Higher (no verification step) |
| Cost | $15-25/review (token-based) | Free (open source) |
| Setup | Admin toggle + GitHub App | Manual workflow configuration |
| Availability | Team/Enterprise only | Anyone |

For teams where catching bugs before merge is worth the cost, Code Review is the obvious choice. For open-source projects or cost-sensitive teams, the GitHub Action still provides solid value.

## When Code Review Shines

Code Review is most valuable on:

- **Large PRs** -- 84% of 1,000+ line PRs get findings, averaging 7.5 issues each
- **Cross-cutting changes** -- Refactors that touch authentication, encryption, or data integrity
- **Complex logic** -- Anything where the bug isn't in the syntax but in the reasoning
- **High-stakes codebases** -- Production services where a missed bug means an incident

For small, isolated changes, the 31% finding rate with 0.5 average issues means it stays quiet when there's nothing to say. That's the right behavior.

## Fitting Code Review into Your Workflow

Code Review works alongside your existing git workflow. It doesn't replace human reviewers -- it gives them a head start by surfacing the issues worth discussing.

A practical pattern for teams using Claude Code:

1. Developer creates a PR using Claude Code's git integration
2. Code Review runs automatically (~20 minutes)
3. Human reviewer reads the Code Review summary first
4. Reviewer focuses their attention on flagged areas
5. Human approves (or requests changes) based on both AI and their own review

This works especially well with agent-based development workflows where Claude Code generates significant amounts of code. The more code an AI writes, the more valuable an AI reviewer becomes -- it can analyze the full diff at a depth no human would sustain.

If you're building with [multi-agent patterns](/blog/sub-agent-best-practices) or [team orchestration](/blog/team-orchestration), Code Review becomes the quality gate that validates what your agents produce. Think of it as the final checkpoint in your feedback loop.

## Getting Started

Claude Code Review is available now as a research preview in beta for Team and Enterprise plans. If you're on a qualifying plan:

1. Have your admin enable it in Claude Code settings
2. Install the GitHub App on your organization
3. Select repositories
4. Open a PR and watch the agents work

For teams not yet on Team or Enterprise, the [open-source GitHub Action](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action) provides a free alternative with lighter analysis.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does Claude Code Review cost?

Claude Code Review is billed on token usage, averaging $15-25 per PR depending on complexity. Small PRs cost less, large refactors cost more. Admins can set monthly spending caps at the organization level.

### Is Claude Code Review free?
