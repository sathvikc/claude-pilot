Configure your terminal for Claude Code. Set up Shift+Enter line breaks, vim mode, notifications, and tips for VS Code and iTerm2.

<!-- truncate -->

Your terminal configuration directly affects how productive you are with Claude Code. Default settings work, but they leave performance on the table. Misconfigured line breaks force you into single-line prompts. Missing notifications mean you walk away and forget to check back. And if you've ever pasted a 200-line code block only to watch it get truncated, you already know why this matters.

This guide covers every terminal setting worth configuring: theme matching, multi-line input, notifications, large input handling, vim mode, and specific tips for the terminals developers actually use. If you've already installed Claude Code and set up your basic configuration, this is where you fine-tune the experience.

## Theme Matching

Claude Code doesn't control your terminal's appearance. Your terminal application owns that. But you can sync Claude Code's internal theme to match your terminal's color scheme at any time.

Run `/config` inside Claude Code and select the theme option. This adjusts Claude Code's syntax highlighting, status indicators, and UI elements to fit your terminal's light or dark background.

You can also configure a custom status line through `/config` that displays contextual information at the bottom of your terminal. This is useful for keeping the current model, working directory, or git branch visible without running extra commands.

If you switch between light and dark modes throughout the day, run `/config` again after switching. Claude Code won't detect the change automatically.

## Multi-Line Input: Four Ways to Write Better Prompts

Single-line prompts limit what you can express. Complex instructions, code snippets, and multi-step requests all benefit from line breaks. Claude Code supports four different methods.

### Method 1: Backslash + Enter (Works Everywhere)

Type `\` followed by Enter to create a newline. This works in every terminal on every platform. It's the universal fallback when nothing else is configured.

```
Write a function that\
takes two arguments\
and returns their sum
```

It's not elegant, but it's reliable. Use this when you're SSH'd into a remote server or working in an unfamiliar terminal.

### Method 2: Shift+Enter (Native Support)

Four terminals support Shift+Enter for line breaks out of the box with zero configuration:

- **iTerm2**
- **WezTerm**
- **Ghostty**
- **Kitty**

If you use any of these, Shift+Enter already works. No setup required. This is the most natural input method since it matches what you're used to in chat applications and text editors.

### Method 3: /terminal-setup (Auto-Configuration)

For terminals that don't support Shift+Enter natively, Claude Code includes a built-in setup command. Run `/terminal-setup` inside Claude Code and it will automatically configure Shift+Enter for your terminal.

This command supports:

- **VS Code** integrated terminal
- **Alacritty**
- **Zed**
- **Warp**

One important detail: you won't see the `/terminal-setup` command if you're using a terminal that already has native Shift+Enter support (iTerm2, WezTerm, Ghostty, Kitty). The command only appears in terminals that need manual configuration.

After running `/terminal-setup`, restart your terminal for the changes to take effect.

### Method 4: Option+Enter (Mac)

On macOS, you can configure Option+Enter as an alternative line break key. This requires a one-time settings change depending on your terminal.

**For Mac Terminal.app:**

1. Open Settings, then Profiles, then Keyboard
2. Check "Use Option as Meta Key"

**For iTerm2 and VS Code terminal:**

1. Open Settings, then Profiles, then Keys
2. Under General, set Left/Right Option key to "Esc+"

Option+Enter is particularly useful if you're already using Option as a modifier key in your workflow. It keeps Shift available for text selection.

## Notification Setup

Claude Code tasks can take minutes for complex operations. Walking away without notifications means you're either watching paint dry or forgetting to come back. Proper notification setup solves both problems.

### iTerm2 System Notifications

iTerm2 supports native macOS notifications when Claude Code finishes a task:

1. Open iTerm2 Preferences
2. Navigate to Profiles, then Terminal
3. Enable "Silence bell"
4. Under Filter Alerts, enable "Send escape sequence-generated alerts"
5. Set your preferred notification delay

After this setup, macOS will display a notification banner whenever Claude completes a long-running task. These notifications work even when iTerm2 is minimized or you've switched to another app.

Note: these notifications are specific to iTerm2. The default macOS Terminal.app does not support this feature.

### Custom Notification Hooks

For more advanced notification handling, Claude Code supports custom notification hooks. These let you run your own logic when specific events occur, such as sending a Slack message, playing a sound, or triggering a webhook.

Notification hooks are part of Claude Code's broader [hooks system](/blog/hooks-guide). You can set them up to fire on task completion, errors, or specific output patterns.

## Handling Large Inputs

Pasting long code blocks or extensive instructions directly into Claude Code can cause problems. The input buffer in most terminals has limits, and exceeding them leads to truncated or garbled text.

Three rules for large inputs:

**1. Don't paste directly.** If your input exceeds roughly 100 lines, write it to a file instead. Then tell Claude Code to read the file:

```
Read the contents of ./context/large-spec.md and implement the requirements
```

**2. Watch for VS Code terminal limits.** The VS Code integrated terminal is particularly aggressive about truncating long pastes. If you work primarily in VS Code, the file-based approach isn't optional. It's necessary for anything beyond short prompts.

**3. Break large requests into steps.** Instead of pasting an entire specification, break it into logical chunks. Give Claude Code one section at a time, verify the output, then continue. This also produces better results because Claude can focus on each piece individually.

For developers who frequently work with large codebases, combining file-based input with context management strategies keeps sessions productive without hitting buffer limits.

## Vim Mode

If your muscle memory runs on hjkl navigation, Claude Code has you covered. A built-in vim mode provides a subset of standard vim keybindings for the input area.

### Enabling Vim Mode

Two ways to turn it on:

- Type `/vim` in Claude Code to toggle vim mode immediately
- Run `/config` and enable vim mode in the settings (persists across sessions)

When enabled, you'll start in NORMAL mode. The standard mode indicator appears in the input area so you always know which mode you're in.

### Complete Keybinding Reference

Here's every supported keybinding, organized by category.

**Mode Switching:**

| `I` | Insert at beginning of line |
| `a` | Insert after cursor |
| `A` | Insert at end of line |
| `o` | Open new line below |
| `O` | Open new line above |

**Navigation:**

| Key | Action |

### When Vim Mode Helps

Vim mode shines when you're writing longer, multi-line prompts. If you're giving Claude Code detailed instructions with specific file paths, code snippets, and multi-step requirements, vim-style navigation and editing saves real time. Jumping between words with `w` and `b`, deleting to end of line with `D`, and yanking/pasting sections with `yy`/`p` all feel natural if you're already a vim user.

It's also useful when you need to edit a prompt you've already started typing. Instead of holding backspace or using arrow keys, you can navigate precisely with vim motions and make surgical edits.

### When to Skip Vim Mode

If you don't already use vim, don't start here. The learning curve isn't worth it for Claude Code's input field alone. Standard input works perfectly fine for most prompts. Vim mode is a quality-of-life feature for developers who already think in vim, not a prerequisite for being productive.

## Terminal-Specific Tips

### VS Code Integrated Terminal

- Run `/terminal-setup` to enable Shift+Enter for multi-line input
- Be aware of paste truncation on long inputs. Use file-based workflows for anything over 100 lines
- The VS Code terminal shares resources with the editor. If you're running multiple extensions, Claude Code may feel slower. Consider using a separate terminal window for intensive sessions
- Configure Option+Enter by setting the Option key to "Esc+" in terminal settings

### iTerm2

- Shift+Enter works natively. No setup needed
- Enable system notifications through Profiles, then Terminal, then "Silence bell" for task completion alerts
- Set Option key to "Esc+" under Profiles, then Keys for Option+Enter support
- iTerm2's tmux integration works well with parallel Claude Code sessions

### Warp

- Run `/terminal-setup` to configure Shift+Enter
- Warp's block-based input can occasionally interfere with Claude Code's prompt detection. If you experience issues, try switching to classic input mode

### Alacritty

- Run `/terminal-setup` to configure Shift+Enter
- Alacritty's GPU-accelerated rendering makes it one of the fastest terminals for Claude Code output. If you're working with large file outputs, the performance difference is noticeable

### Ghostty

- Shift+Enter works natively
- Ghostty is relatively new but already has solid Claude Code compatibility. Its native macOS rendering and fast startup make it a strong choice for dedicated Claude Code sessions

### Kitty

- Shift+Enter works natively
- Kitty's GPU rendering handles long Claude Code outputs smoothly
- Its built-in multiplexer lets you run parallel sessions without tmux

## Putting It All Together

A fully configured terminal setup for Claude Code looks like this:

1. **Theme matched** via `/config` so syntax highlighting is readable
2. **Multi-line input** configured via your preferred method (Shift+Enter or Option+Enter)
3. **Notifications** enabled so you know when tasks complete
4. **Large input strategy** decided: file-based workflows for anything substantial
5. **Vim mode** enabled if you're already a vim user

Get these five pieces right and your terminal stops being an obstacle. It becomes the control surface it's supposed to be.

From here, explore terminal-as-main-thread workflows to coordinate multiple Claude Code sessions in parallel, or dive into keybinding customization for additional workflow shortcuts.
