"""PermissionRequest hook for ExitPlanMode: approval-state-aware allow/deny.

In the /spec workflow ExitPlanMode is purely a model-switch lever (Opus -> Sonnet),
NOT the plan-approval mechanism. The real approval is a separate AskUserQuestion gate
(spec-plan/steps/12-approval.md, spec-bugfix-plan/steps/06-approval.md).

Two jobs:
1. DENY a premature ExitPlanMode. Newer Claude Code builds inject a plan-mode
   system-reminder claiming the plan must be presented for approval via
   ExitPlanMode and no other way; models sometimes follow it and call
   ExitPlanMode BEFORE the AskUserQuestion gate. While the planning leg is
   active (plan-mode-active sentinel from EnterPlanMode) and the registered
   plan is PENDING and unapproved, ExitPlanMode is denied with a message that
   re-anchors the model to the approval gate.
2. ALLOW otherwise: skip the dialog + request bypassPermissions restore. The
   decision message must NEVER say "approved": earlier wording ("Plan
   auto-approved") was parroted by agents as "Plan approved", causing them to
   skip the approval gate and start implementing.
3. RESTORE bypassPermissions after the plan exit. Two upstream issues break
   the naive restore on current CC builds:
     #49525 - updatedPermissions setMode:bypassPermissions is silently dropped
              when sent on the ExitPlanMode request itself (CC 2.1.110+): the
              plan-exit mode transition applies after the hook's update and
              clobbers it
     #39973 - ExitPlanMode resets the session to acceptEdits regardless of the
              prior mode
   So the allow path arms a session-scoped marker (bypass-restore-pending) and
   the hook - registered with a "*" PermissionRequest matcher - replays the
   setMode on the FIRST subsequent permission request, where no mode
   transition follows to clobber it. Arming requires POSITIVE pre-plan bypass
   evidence: plan_mode_tracker records permission_mode at
   PreToolUse(EnterPlanMode) (before the mode flips to "plan"), and only a
   recorded "bypassPermissions" arms the marker - so a session whose user
   deliberately runs without bypass (or a shift-tab plan entry, which records
   nothing) never gets a prompt auto-allowed. The replay only fires while the
   session sits in a mode the plan exit involuntarily drops it into
   (acceptEdits per #39973, or default/manual via the >=2.1.204 exit dialog);
   plan mode or an unknown mode stands down, and the marker is consumed
   without output. CC additionally no-ops setMode:bypassPermissions for
   sessions not launched with bypass available. The setMode on the
   ExitPlanMode allow stays: it is harmless today and self-fixing once #49525
   ships, at which point the marker replay simply never sees a prompt.
   Lifecycle: the marker and the evidence record are tiny per-session files;
   both are consumed single-shot and overwritten by the next planning leg, so
   a session that ends between arm and replay leaves only harmless garbage.

Guard scope (honest limits): the deny only arms AFTER `pilot register-plan`
has written active_plan.json (spec-plan Step 2) and while the EnterPlanMode
sentinel exists; the window before registration, and installs where the pilot
binary is unavailable, remain guarded by skill prose only. Everything fails
open: read errors, a missing/unreadable plan file, an unparseable
active_plan.json, or a version-skewed _lib all fall back to plain allow (for
ExitPlanMode) or to silence = the normal permission dialog (for every other
tool), so no permission request is ever broken or auto-allowed by accident.
The deny message carries a user-authorized escape hatch (remove the sentinel)
for abandoned or non-/spec plan-mode legs.
