"""Track EnterPlanMode/ExitPlanMode state via a session-scoped sentinel file.

Registered as:
  PostToolUse(EnterPlanMode) -> writes the sentinel
  PostToolUse(ExitPlanMode)  -> deletes the sentinel
  PreToolUse(Edit|Write|MultiEdit) -> injects a warning if the sentinel is active
                                      and the target file is not a plan doc;
                                      for plan-doc writes, verifies the observed
                                      planning-leg model (see below)

The sentinel lives at:
  ~/.pilot/sessions/<session_id>/plan-mode-active

Purpose: ensure spec-implement never runs on Opus because ExitPlanMode was
accidentally skipped. The warning gives the model one last chance to call
ExitPlanMode before touching implementation files. Plan mode is only entered
by /spec in AUTOMATED Model Switching mode; Manual/Off never toggle it.

Planning-leg model check (Automated mode only): plan mode under opusplan
must run on Opus - but Claude Code can silently serve the Sonnet leg instead
(Opus usage-limit fallback, a conversation grown past Opus's effective ~200K
window on accounts without 1M entitlement, or the session was never on the
opusplan model). EnterPlanMode itself cannot observe this (the statusline has
not re-rendered in the new mode yet), so the check runs at the first plan-doc
write after EnterPlanMode: by then the statusline cache carries a post-lever
render (cache mtime > sentinel mtime) and its model_id is authoritative. On a
mismatch a once-per-planning-leg warning is injected so the workflow reports
the real model instead of narrating an unverified "switched to Opus".
