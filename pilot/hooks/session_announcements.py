"""SessionStart hook (Claude Code only): deliver one-time announcements.

Each announcement is injected into the session via `additionalContext` exactly
once. The hook touches the ack sentinel itself before injecting, so the message
shows once regardless of session outcome -- no AskUserQuestion round-trip needed.

Extensible: add entries to ANNOUNCEMENTS. Stdlib only (package boundary);
never raises.
