"""Stop guard for /spec workflow - prevents early finishing when plan is active.

Only allows stopping when:
1. Asking user for plan approval (AskUserQuestion tool)
2. Asking user for an important decision (AskUserQuestion tool)
3. No active plan exists (not in /spec mode)
4. User stops again within 60s cooldown (escape hatch)
5. Runaway cap: after MAX_BLOCKS consecutive blocks for the same plan with no
   user-question turn in between, emit one escalation block instructing the
   agent to AskUserQuestion. The next block-attempt after escalation is
   allowed through, breaking pathological infinite verify→implement loops.
