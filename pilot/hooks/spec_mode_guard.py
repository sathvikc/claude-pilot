"""Guard for /spec invocations (UserPromptSubmit hook).

- Always blocks /spec when the user is manually in plan mode (in Automated
  mode the skill, not the user, enters plan mode via EnterPlanMode).
- Warns when not in bypassPermissions mode.
- Model gate (three-way Model Switching mode, read FRESH from config.json):
    * automated: the session must run `opusplan`, whose non-plan leg is Sonnet,
      so at /spec-submit time a correct user shows Sonnet. A non-Sonnet model
      (e.g. plain Opus or plain Fable) means they are not on `opusplan` --
      blocked, UNLESS settings.json shows `opusplan` is the selected model AND
      the cache is not a Fable id (the async statusline cache may lag the
      `/model opusplan` the user just ran; a Fable cache value, never an
      opusplan resolution, is proof the session is live on Fable and stays
      blocked). A user wrongly on plain Sonnet is indistinguishable from
      opusplan and is allowed (accepted false-negative).
      Additionally, a pre-flight context check warns (non-blocking) when the
      conversation likely exceeds the Opus plan leg's effective window --
      Claude Code would then silently keep serving the Sonnet leg.
    * manual / off: NO model gate. Manual mode's /spec flow reminds the user
      to pick their planning model themselves; off means Pilot stays out of
      model management entirely.

Reads:
  - `permission_mode` from hook stdin (plan-mode block, bypassPermissions warn)
  - the Model Switching mode fresh from ~/.pilot/config.json ("manual" fallback)
  - `model_id` from the statusline cache at ``~/.pilot/sessions/<sid>/context-pct.json``
  - `model` from ``$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/settings.json`` (the *selected* alias,
    persisted synchronously by `/model`) as the opusplan tie-breaker
