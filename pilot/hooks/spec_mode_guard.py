"""Guard for /spec invocations (UserPromptSubmit hook).

- Always blocks /spec when the user is manually in plan mode (the skill, not the
  user, enters plan mode via EnterPlanMode for the Opus planning leg).
- Warns when not in bypassPermissions mode.
- Model gate (runs in BOTH toggle states, expected model flipped):
    * Switching ON (default): the session runs `opusplan`, whose non-plan leg is
      Sonnet, so at /spec-submit time a correct user shows Sonnet. A non-Sonnet
      model (e.g. plain Opus) means they never ran `/model opusplan` -- blocked,
      UNLESS settings.json shows `opusplan` is the selected model (the async
      statusline cache may lag the `/model opusplan` the user just ran).
      A user wrongly on plain Sonnet is indistinguishable from opusplan and is
      allowed (accepted false-negative, avoids false-blocking correct users).
    * Switching OFF: the whole workflow runs on Opus and only Opus may enter plan
      mode, so a non-Opus model is blocked with a `/model opus[1m]` prompt. An
      explicit `opusplan` selection is blocked with targeted guidance instead:
      turn Model Switching ON (Console) or run `/model opus[1m]`.
    * Fable-family models (e.g. `claude-fable-5`, `claude-mythos-5`, `best`)
      pass the gate in BOTH states: they run the whole workflow single-model,
      so neither prompt applies.

Reads:
  - `permission_mode` from hook stdin (plan-mode block, bypassPermissions warn)
  - `PILOT_MODEL_SWITCH_ENABLED` from env (selects expected model; default ON)
  - `model_id` from the statusline cache at ``~/.pilot/sessions/<sid>/context-pct.json``
    -- the statusline writes this every render and Claude Code UserPromptSubmit
    stdin does NOT include the active model field.
  - `model` from ``$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/settings.json`` (default ``~/.claude``)
    -- the *selected* model alias, persisted synchronously by `/model`. The
    statusline cache only ever holds the *resolved* model id (opusplan resolves
    to its Sonnet leg outside plan mode), so this is the only place an explicit
    `opusplan` selection is observable. Consulted as a tie-breaker when the
    cache would block: ON + opusplan selected passes (the cache may lag the
    `/model opusplan` the user just ran); OFF + opusplan selected blocks with
    guidance naming the Model Switching toggle instead of the generic
    requires-Opus message.
