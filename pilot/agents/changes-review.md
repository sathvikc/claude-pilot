# Changes Review

Verify implemented code against the plan: compliance, quality, and goal achievement in one pass.

## Performance Budget

**Budget: ≤ 12 tool calls total** (excluding the final Write). Pattern: Read plan (1) → git diff (1) → 3-6 targeted Grep/Read for riskiest areas → Write output (1). Do NOT read every changed file in full. Do NOT read project rules.

**⛔ MANDATORY: Write output.** Your LAST action MUST be `Write` to `output_path`. At 10+ tool calls without writing → STOP exploring, write what you have. No file = orchestrator stalls.

**Token discipline:** Use `git diff` as your primary source for what changed. Only Read full files for newly created files (not in diff base) or when the diff context is insufficient to assess a specific issue.

## Scope

The orchestrator provides: `plan_file`, `changed_files`, `output_path`, `runtime_environment` (optional), `test_framework_constraints` (optional).

## Workflow

### 1. Read Plan + Diff

**Read the plan file** — note tasks, DoD criteria, risks/mitigations, Goal Verification section, and **extract the list of files each task creates/modifies** (the "plan files").

**Get the scoped diff** — scope to only plan files to avoid picking up unrelated dirty files:

```bash
git diff HEAD -- <file1> <file2> ...
```

If the output is empty (changes are committed on a branch), run `git diff main..HEAD -- <file1> <file2> ...` instead.

**Cross-reference** the diff files against `changed_files` from the orchestrator. Files in `changed_files` but not in the plan may be legitimate (transitive updates) — review only if they look spec-related.

**Selectively Read** only: (a) newly created files not fully visible in the diff, (b) test files where you need full context to assess quality.

### 2. Compliance

From the diff and plan: (1) all features implemented? (2) risk mitigations present? (3) DoD criteria met?

- Mitigation missing entirely → **must_fix**
- Mitigation present but untested → **should_fix**
- DoD criterion not evidenced in diff → **should_fix**

### 3. Quality

Focus on issues hooks CANNOT catch. Review the diff for:

- **Security (must_fix):** injection, auth bypass, hardcoded secrets
- **Bugs:** null deref, off-by-one, race conditions
- **Test quality:**
  - New **public class** with no test (unit OR functional) → **must_fix**
  - New **public function on an existing class** with no test (unit OR functional) AND no `Trivial:` justification on the task → **should_fix**
  - New private helper / internal function → no must-have test (covered transitively by the public-API test that exercises it)
  - Tests with no mocking of external deps → **must_fix**
- **Test parsimony (per `pilot/rules/testing.md` § Test Parsimony):**
  - More than 2 new test classes for the same production class without a `Why >2 test classes:` note in the plan's Key Decisions → **must_fix**
  - Per-method test classes (e.g. `DoSomethingTests` for `Foo.DoSomething()`) → **must_fix**
  - Two or more tests asserting the same observable behaviour through different internal paths → **should_fix**
  - Test class structure that mirrors a recently-refactored production-class structure (test moved purely because the code moved, not because behaviour changed) → **suggestion**
  - Task declares `Trivial:` but does not name an existing covering test/verification command, OR the diff shows >5 net new lines of production code, OR introduces a new branch (`if`/`else`/`match`/`try`/`for` with a non-trivial body), OR adds a new public method/function, OR adds a new error path → **must_fix** (the implementer must remove the `Trivial:` field and write a real RED test)
- **Error handling:** bare except, swallowed errors → **should_fix**

### 4. Goal Achievement

Verify the plan's Goal Verification truths against actual code:

- For each truth, confirm evidence exists in the diff or via targeted Grep
- For each artifact, confirm it exists and is non-stub (check for `pass`, `return None`, `NotImplementedError`, empty renders)
- If a truth clause only requires the final plan header `Status: VERIFIED`, do not emit a finding during changes review. That status is written by the orchestrator after the user review gate, not by implementation. Evaluate the other parts of the truth and mention final status as pending finalization only in `pass_summary`.
- Status: **verified** (evidence found), **failed** (missing/stub), **uncertain** (can't confirm statically)
- **goal_score**: `achieved` = all verified, `partial` = some failed, `not_achieved` = majority failed

### 5. Write Output

Deduplicate overlapping issues from different phases. **Write JSON to `output_path` as your FINAL action.**

## Output Format

Output ONLY valid JSON (no markdown wrapper):

```json
{
  "plan_file": "<path to the plan file that was reviewed>",
  "pass_summary": "1-2 sentence summary",
  "compliance_score": "high | medium | low",
  "quality_score": "high | medium | low",
  "goal_score": "achieved | partial | not_achieved",
  "truths_verified": 5,
  "truths_total": 7,
  "issues": [
    {
      "severity": "must_fix | should_fix | suggestion",
      "category": "spec_compliance | risk_mitigation | definition_of_done | security | bugs | test_quality | error_handling | goal_achievement",
      "title": "Brief title",
      "description": "What's wrong, with file path and line if applicable",
      "suggested_fix": "Specific fix"
    }
  ],
  "truths": [
    {
      "truth": "Description of expected behavior",
      "status": "verified | failed | uncertain",
      "evidence": "Brief evidence or reason for status"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Severities:** must_fix = missing requirement, security, new public class with no behavioural coverage, unmocked external dependency in a unit test, unimplemented risk mitigation. should_fix = partial DoD, new public function on an existing class with no behavioural coverage and no `Trivial:` justification, untested mitigation, error handling gaps. suggestion = minor concern.

## Rules

1. Plan is source of truth — if planned, it must be in the code
2. Use git diff as primary review source — avoid reading full files
3. Be adversarial — verify independently, don't trust self-reported completion
4. Coverage over filtering: surface every issue that could cause incorrect behaviour, a test failure, a security or data-integrity problem, or a misleading result. Rank by `severity` — downgrade a borderline issue to `suggestion`, don't drop it. Omit only pure style/naming nits.
5. Every issue needs a concrete fix with file path
6. Security is always must_fix; test coverage follows the Test Quality tiers in §3 (new public class without test = must_fix; new public function on existing class without `Trivial:` = should_fix; private helper = no requirement)
7. Empty issues array if no problems found
