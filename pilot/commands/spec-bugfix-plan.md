# /spec-bugfix-plan - Bugfix Planning Phase

**Phase 1 (bugfix).** Investigates root cause, creates lean fix plan, gets approval.

**Input:** Bug description (new) or plan path (continue unapproved)
**Output:** Approved bugfix plan at `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` with `Type: Bugfix`
**Next:** On approval → `Skill(skill='spec-implement', args='<plan-path>')`

---

## Iron Law

```
NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE INVESTIGATION FIRST
```

If you haven't completed Step 1.2, you cannot propose fixes. Symptom fixes are failure.

---

## Critical Constraints

- **NEVER write code during planning** — planning and implementation are separate phases
- **NEVER assume — verify by reading files.** Trace the bug to actual file:line.
- **Right-size the plan** — small bugs get lean plans. Don't over-engineer.
- **Plan file is source of truth** — survives across auto-compaction cycles
- **ALWAYS use `AskUserQuestion` tool** for clarifications — never list numbered questions in plain text

> **NOTE: During `/spec`, use the structured workflow below — not CC's native plan mode.**

## Red Flags — STOP and Follow Process

If you catch yourself thinking any of these, STOP. Return to Step 1.2.

- "Quick fix for now, investigate later"
- "Just try changing X and see if it works"
- "It's probably X, let me fix that"
- "I don't fully understand but this might work"
- Proposing solutions before tracing data flow
- "One more fix attempt" (when already tried 2+)
- Each fix reveals a new problem in a different place

---

## Step 1.1: Create Plan File Header (FIRST)

1. **Parse worktree** from arguments: `--worktree=yes|no` (default: `No`). Strip flag.
2. **Create worktree early (if yes):** Same pattern as spec-plan Step 1.1.
3. **Generate filename:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<bug-slug>.md`
4. `mkdir -p docs/plans`
5. **Write header:**
   ```markdown
   # [Bug Description] Fix Plan

   Created: [Date]
   Status: PENDING
   Approved: No
   Iterations: 0
   Worktree: [Yes|No]
   Type: Bugfix

   > Investigating bug...

   ## Summary
   **Symptom:** [Bug description from user]

   ---
   _Tracing root cause..._
   ```
6. **Register:** `~/.pilot/bin/pilot register-plan "<plan_path>" "PENDING" 2>/dev/null || true`

---

## Step 1.2: Root Cause Investigation

**Complete each sub-step before the next. No shortcuts.**

### 1.2.1: Reproduce & Understand

1. Restate: **symptom** (what user observes), **trigger** (when/how), **expected behavior**
2. If too vague: `AskUserQuestion` with ONE focused question
3. Can you trigger it reliably? What are the exact steps?
4. If not reproducible: gather more data, don't guess

### 1.2.2: Check Recent Changes

- What changed that could cause this? `git log --oneline -10 -- <file>`, `git diff`
- New dependencies, config changes, environmental differences?

### 1.2.3: Trace the Root Cause

Read as many files as needed. For each: read completely, trace execution path from user action to symptom, note specific lines where behavior diverges.

**Backward tracing technique (from symptom to source):**
1. Find where the error/wrong behavior appears — note file:line
2. What called this with the wrong value/state? Trace one level up.
3. Keep tracing until you find the **source** — where the bad data originates
4. **Fix at the source, not where the error appears**

**Multi-component systems:** Before concluding, instrument at component boundaries:
- What data enters each component? What exits?
- WHERE does it break? Run once to gather evidence, THEN investigate the failing component.

Tools: Probe CLI `probe search` (find by intent), `probe extract` (extract functions by symbol), Read/Grep/Glob (direct exploration).

### 1.2.4: Pattern Analysis

1. Find **working examples** — similar code in the codebase that works correctly
2. Compare: what's different between working and broken?
3. List every difference, however small — don't assume "that can't matter"

### 1.2.5: Root Cause Statement

State clearly:
- **Root cause:** `file/path.py:lineN` — `function_name()` does X but should do Y
- **Why:** Explain WHY it causes the symptom (not just what's wrong)
- **Confidence:** High (traced fully) / Medium (strong hypothesis) / Low (needs more data)

If confidence is Low: gather more evidence. Don't guess.

**Escalation:** If 3+ hypotheses have failed, STOP — this is likely an architectural problem, not a simple bug. `AskUserQuestion` to discuss with user before continuing.

---

## Step 1.3: Plan the Fix

### Gate Function — Before Planning

```
BEFORE writing the plan:
  1. Can I state the root cause with file:line? If NO → back to 1.2
  2. Can I explain WHY it causes the symptom? If NO → back to 1.2
  3. Is my confidence High or Medium? If LOW → back to 1.2
```

### Size the task structure

| Size | Criteria | Tasks |
|------|----------|-------|
| **Compact** (default) | ≤3 files, clear root cause | 2: Fix (test + code) → Verify |
| **Full** | 4+ files, multiple failure modes | 3: Tests → Fix → Verify |

### Compact (most bugs)

**Task 1: Fix** — Write regression test → verify FAILS → implement fix → verify all PASS.
**Task 2: Verify** — Full test suite, lint, type check.

### Full (complex bugs)

**Task 1: Write Tests** — regression + preservation tests (if fix touches shared code paths).
**Task 2: Implement Fix** — minimal fix at root cause.
**Task 3: Verify** — full suite, lint, type check.

**Regression tests must exercise existing public entry points** (not internal helpers you plan to create). The test answers: "Under the bug condition, does the system produce the correct result?"

**Defense-in-depth:** When the bug was caused by invalid data flowing through multiple layers, plan validation at every layer the data passes through — not just the source. Entry point validation, business logic validation, environment guards where appropriate.

---

## Step 1.4: Write the Bugfix Plan

**Save to:** `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<bug-name>.md`

```markdown
# [Bug Description] Fix Plan

Created: [Date]
Status: PENDING
Approved: No
Iterations: 0
Worktree: [Yes|No]
Type: Bugfix

## Summary
**Symptom:** [What user observes]
**Trigger:** [When/how it happens]
**Root Cause:** `file/path.py:lineN` — [what's wrong and why]

## Investigation
- [Key findings from tracing — breadcrumb trail so implementer understands the bug]
- [Working example for comparison, if relevant]
- [Recent changes that may have caused it, if relevant]

## Fix Approach
**Files:** [files to modify]
**Strategy:** [how to fix — reference pattern from working code if applicable]
**Tests:** [test files to create/modify]
**Defense-in-depth:** [additional validation layers, if applicable — skip for isolated fixes]

## Progress
- [ ] Task 1: [title]
- [ ] Task 2: [title]
**Tasks:** N | **Done:** 0

## Tasks
### Task 1: [Title]
**Objective:** [what]
**Files:** [list]
**TDD:** Write regression test → verify FAILS → implement fix → verify all PASS
**Verify:** `[command]`

### Task 2: Verify
**Objective:** Full suite + quality checks
**Verify:** `uv run pytest -q && ruff check . && basedpyright launcher`
```

**Do NOT include:** Status lifecycle blockquote, separate "Testing Strategy" section, "Goal Verification / Truths / Artifacts" sections, "Risks and Mitigations" table, "Prerequisites" section, per-task "Definition of Done" checklists, per-task "Dependencies" field.

## Step 1.5: Get User Approval

0. Notify:
   ```bash
   ~/.pilot/bin/pilot notify plan_approval "Bugfix Plan Ready" "<plan-slug> — approval needed" --plan-path "<plan_path>" 2>/dev/null || true
   ```
1. Summarize: symptom → root cause → fix approach → task structure
2. AskUserQuestion: "Yes, proceed" | "No, let me edit"
3. **Yes:** Set `Approved: Yes`, invoke `Skill(skill='spec-implement', args='<plan-path>')`
   **No:** User edits, re-read, ask again. **Other:** Incorporate, re-ask.

---

## Continuing Unapproved Bugfix Plans

When arguments end with `.md`: read plan, check Status/Approved. Resume from wherever planning left off: no investigation yet → Step 1.2. Has investigation, no tasks → Step 1.3. Complete but unapproved → Step 1.5.
