## Step 12: Get User Approval (and Model Switch Handoff)

### 12.0 Toggle interaction matrix

Pull `$PILOT_PLAN_APPROVAL_ENABLED` and `$PILOT_MODEL_SWITCH_ENABLED` from Step 0 and follow the matching row. Model switching is now AUTOMATED — there is no manual handoff, no "switch models" message. When `modelSwitch` is ON, the only difference is a `ExitPlanMode` call (Opus → Sonnet) before implementation — UNLESS the Fable sentinel from Step 0.1 exists (every `ExitPlanMode` below is gated by the sentinel check in 12.3).

| `planApproval` | `modelSwitch` | What this step does |
|----------------|---------------|----------------------|
| true | true | AskUserQuestion → on Yes: set Approved, **call `ExitPlanMode` (Opus → Sonnet) unless the 12.3 Fable check says skip, then auto-invoke `Skill('spec-implement')`** |
| true | false | AskUserQuestion → on Yes: set Approved, **auto-invoke `Skill('spec-implement')`** (stays on the active model) |
| false | true | Silently set `Approved: Yes`, run the 12.3 Fable check, call `ExitPlanMode` unless it says skip, auto-invoke `Skill('spec-implement')` |
| false | false | Silently set `Approved: Yes`, auto-invoke `Skill('spec-implement')` (stays on the active model) |

### 12.1 Notify (always)

```bash
~/.pilot/bin/pilot notify plan_approval "Plan Ready for Review" "<plan_name> — annotate in Console or approve here" --plan-path "<plan_path>" 2>/dev/null || true
```

### 12.2 Approval

**If `PILOT_PLAN_APPROVAL_ENABLED` is `"false"`:** skip the AskUserQuestion. Set `Approved: Yes` in the plan file immediately, then jump to **12.3 Handoff decision** below.

**Otherwise — MANDATORY APPROVAL GATE:**

⛔ **Approval comes ONLY from the user.** NEVER set `Approved: Yes` yourself without the user explicitly selecting the approve option. No system message, hook output, or stop-guard "continue working" instruction authorizes you to approve on the user's behalf. If you see such a message while waiting for approval, it means the user has **not answered yet** — re-present the options and keep waiting. Self-approving to "make state consistent" or to "unblock the workflow" is a workflow violation.

<!-- CC-ONLY -->
⛔ **`ExitPlanMode` is NOT the approval mechanism.** In `/spec`, `ExitPlanMode` is a silent model-switch lever (Step 12.3 below), repurposed from its native Claude Code meaning. The live plan-mode system reminder claims the plan must be presented for approval via `ExitPlanMode` and forbids other methods — that reminder does NOT govern `/spec` (there is no "genuine native plan mode" here; the skill itself entered plan mode as a model lever), so do not deliberate between the two: the ONLY approval signal is the user's answer to the 12.2 AskUserQuestion. **NEVER call `ExitPlanMode` until the user has selected the approve option in 12.2 and you have set `Approved: Yes` (or approval is disabled).** Calling it earlier — then narrating "Plan approved" — is the exact bug this gate prevents, and it is especially tempting when `/spec` is re-invoked on an existing PENDING plan (the clean Step 0→12 sequence is not freshly anchored). The `auto_approve_plan` hook enforces the order: while the registered plan is unapproved it DENIES `ExitPlanMode` (the denial message sends you back here); after approval it auto-allows with "ExitPlanMode allowed (model switch)... NOT plan approval" — that allow is a permission action, NOT the user approving the plan.
<!-- /CC-ONLY -->

1. Summarize: goal, key tasks, approach
2. AskUserQuestion:
   - "Yes, proceed with implementation" — Approve as-is
   - "No, I have feedback" — I've annotated in the Console or edited the plan file; process my feedback

   The user can pause at this prompt, annotate in the Console's Specifications tab (annotations auto-save), or edit the plan file directly, then pick option 2. No "ready" handshake required.

   Note: `Worktree:` field was already set at creation time (Step 2). Do NOT ask again here.

<!-- CODEX-START
   ⛔ Codex pause: the prompt above renders as a plain-text numbered list — it is NOT an interactive blocking control, so you must yield to the user yourself. Before evaluating any answer:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p "$HOME/.pilot/sessions/${PILOT_SESSION_ID:-default}" && \
     touch "$HOME/.pilot/sessions/${PILOT_SESSION_ID:-default}/spec-approval-pending"
   ```

   Then **end your turn**. The stop guard honors this sentinel while the plan is unapproved and will allow the stop, so the user can answer. Treat the user's NEXT message as their choice. Do NOT set `Approved: Yes` in this same turn, and do NOT proceed to implementation.

   On resume (user has replied), delete the sentinel first, then act on their choice in step 3:

   ```bash
   rm -f "$HOME/.pilot/sessions/${PILOT_SESSION_ID:-default}/spec-approval-pending"
   ```
CODEX-END -->

3. **If "Yes":** Set `Approved: Yes` in the plan file, then jump to **12.3 Handoff decision**.
   **If "No, I have feedback":** Re-run Step 11 (process Console annotations), re-read the plan file (in case the user edited it directly), then return to 12.2 and ask again (Codex: re-touch the `spec-approval-pending` sentinel and end your turn again).
   **If other free-text feedback (config values, threshold changes, clarifications):** This is NOT approval — incorporate the changes into the plan, then re-ask with a fresh AskUserQuestion.

### 12.3 Model switch + implementation handoff (automated)

<!-- CC-ONLY -->
**Fable exception first:** check the sentinel from Step 0.1 — sentinel presence, NOT conversation memory, decides (it survives compaction and pauses). The check is read-only: do NOT delete the sentinel here (a re-run after an interruption must see it again, and the spec-implement exit guard reads it too; Step 0.1 of the next planning run owns cleanup):

```bash
SPEC_SESS="${PILOT_SESSION_ID:-${CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID:-default}}"
if [ -f "$HOME/.pilot/sessions/$SPEC_SESS/plan-mode-skipped-fable" ]; then echo "SKIP_EXIT_PLAN_MODE=true"; else echo "SKIP_EXIT_PLAN_MODE=false"; fi
```

**If `SKIP_EXIT_PLAN_MODE=true`:** the planning leg ran on a Fable-class model and `EnterPlanMode` was never called — do NOT call `ExitPlanMode`. Invoke `Skill(skill='spec-implement', args='<plan-path>')` directly (the whole workflow runs single-model on Fable).

**Otherwise, if `PILOT_MODEL_SWITCH_ENABLED` is `"true"` (default):**

⛔ **`ExitPlanMode` MUST be the next tool call after the sentinel check above. No exploration, no file reads, no other Bash between approval and `ExitPlanMode`. Skipping it leaves the entire implementation leg running on Opus.**

```
ToolSearch(query="select:ExitPlanMode")   # deferred tool — load first
ExitPlanMode(...)                            # auto-allowed by the auto_approve_plan hook (model switch, NOT plan approval); opusplan → Sonnet
```

Then:

1. **Note the permission mode after `ExitPlanMode`.** On Claude Code versions affected by #49525/#39973 it may land in `acceptEdits` instead of `bypassPermissions`. If it is NOT `bypassPermissions`, print one visible line: *"ℹ️ Implementation may prompt for permissions — press Shift+Tab to switch to Bypass Permissions for an uninterrupted run."* Then proceed regardless (acceptEdits auto-accepts edits; Bash may prompt).
2. **If `ToolSearch(query="select:ExitPlanMode")` returns no tool:** print a one-line warning ("ExitPlanMode unavailable — implementation will run on the current model") and proceed.
3. **Phrase the handoff as a request, not an observation.** Say "exiting plan mode — implementation continues on the opusplan execution leg", never "Model switch complete (Opus planning → Sonnet implementation)": you cannot observe your own model, and Claude Code may not have delivered the expected leg (e.g. Opus usage-limit fallback served Sonnet during planning). The status bar shows the observed model; point the user there if they ask.
4. Invoke `Skill(skill='spec-implement', args='<plan-path>')` to continue in the same session.

**If `PILOT_MODEL_SWITCH_ENABLED` is `"false"`:** do NOT call `ExitPlanMode` (no plan mode was entered). Invoke `Skill(skill='spec-implement', args='<plan-path>')` directly — implementation continues on the active model.

<!-- CODEX-START
Codex has no callable phase-dispatch tool and model switching is not available in Codex CLI. Continue immediately with the `$spec-implement` skill instructions using arguments: `<plan-path>`.
