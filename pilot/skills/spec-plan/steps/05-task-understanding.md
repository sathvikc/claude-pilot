## Step 5: Task Understanding, Discuss & Clarify

1. Restate the task in your own words — core problem, assumptions
2. **Scope check:** Does this task describe multiple independent subsystems (e.g., "build chat, file storage, billing, and analytics")? If so, flag immediately — don't spend questions refining details of a task that needs decomposition first. Suggest splitting into separate plans, one per subsystem, each producing working software on its own. Proceed with the first sub-task.
3. Identify gray areas:

   | Domain      | Typical Gray Areas                                 |
   | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
   | UI/frontend | Layout, interaction patterns, empty/loading states |
   | API/backend | Response shape, error codes, auth, pagination      |
   | CLI/scripts | Output format, flags, exit codes                   |
   | Data/config | Schema, migration, validation, defaults            |

4. **⛔ Code-first rule: before each question, ask "can I answer this from the codebase?"** If yes, do that instead. Use `codegraph_context`, `codegraph_search`, `codegraph_explore`, or Probe to resolve "how does X currently work / where does Y live / what's the current pattern for Z". Only ask the user about decisions the code can't make — purpose, priority trade-offs, scope boundaries, behavioral expectations not yet encoded. Asking the user about facts already in the codebase is the single biggest source of unnecessary friction in planning.

5. **Ask Batch 1 questions** → notify, then use `AskUserQuestion` with each question as a separate entry with predefined options:

   ```bash
   ~/.pilot/bin/pilot notify plan_approval "Input Needed" "<plan_name> — clarification questions" --plan-path "<plan_path>" 2>/dev/null || true
   ```

   Each question must have 2-4 concrete options. Use `multiSelect: true` when choices aren't mutually exclusive.

   Even when the task seems clear, ask about: scope boundaries (what's explicitly out), priority trade-offs (speed vs completeness), or behavioral expectations (error handling, edge cases). **Only skip if the task is a trivial single-file change.**
