# /spec-verify - Verification Phase

**Phase 3 of the /spec workflow (features).** Runs comprehensive verification: automated checks, code review, program execution, and E2E tests. For bugfix plans, use `spec-bugfix-verify` instead.

**Input:** Plan file with `Status: COMPLETE`
**Output:** Plan status → VERIFIED (success) or loop back to implementation (failure)

## ⛔ KEY CONSTRAINTS

<!-- CC-ONLY -->
1. **Run the changes review when enabled** — active whenever `PILOT_CHANGES_REVIEW_ENABLED` is not `"false"` (read in Step 0). The mechanism is `$PILOT_SPEC_CODE_REVIEW_MODE` (fail-closed to `agent`; allow-listed at the points of use): `agent` launches the single `changes-review` sub-agent in the background at Step 1 and collects its findings file in Step 3; `medium`/`high`/`xhigh` runs the built-in `/code-review` skill inline in Step 3 at that effort, AFTER the Step 2 automated checks. To disable, use Console Settings → Reviewers → Changes Review toggle; the mechanism is set in Console Settings → Spec Workflow → Changes Review Mode.
2. **Reviewer sub-agent launches are mode-gated** — Launch `changes-review` via the Agent tool ONLY in agent mode, ONLY via the Step 1 launch (background, findings file, no `TaskOutput`). NEVER launch `spec-review` during verification, and in skill mode launch no reviewer sub-agent at all. `findings-spec-review-*.json` files are stale planning artifacts — ignore them completely; `findings-changes-review-*.json` is valid ONLY when it is the file this run's Step 1 launch wrote (Step 1a deletes stale ones first).
<!-- /CC-ONLY -->
<!-- CODEX-START
1. **Run native Codex changes review when enabled** — Step 1 launches the managed `changes-review` custom agent via `multi_agent_v1.spawn_agent` when `PILOT_CHANGES_REVIEW_ENABLED` is not `"false"` (read in Step 0). Step 3 waits for and applies its findings.
2. **Only changes-review — NEVER spec-review** — Do NOT launch `spec-review` during verification. Planning findings are stale artifacts from the planning phase and must be ignored.
CODEX-END -->
3. **NO stopping** — Everything automatic. Never ask "Should I fix these?"
4. **Fix ALL findings** — must_fix AND should_fix. No permission needed.
5. **Code changes finish BEFORE runtime testing** — Phase A then Phase B.
6. **Plan file is source of truth** — re-read it after auto-compaction, don't rely on conversation memory.
7. **Re-verification after fixes is MANDATORY** — fixes can introduce new bugs.
8. **Quality over speed** — never rush due to context pressure.
