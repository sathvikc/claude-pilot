## Step 3: All Tasks Complete → Verification

1. Check diagnostics. **Run the full test suite ONLY if `Type:` is NOT `Bugfix`.** For bugfix plans, Task 2 ran the suite (anti-regression gate), Task 3 ran it again (post lint/types auto-fixes), and the verify phase will run it once more as the authoritative final check. A fourth run here is wasted runtime (30s–5min) and adds nothing.
2. **For migrations:** Feature parity check against old code. If features missing: add tasks, do NOT mark complete. See sub-section 3.1 below.
3. Set `Status: COMPLETE` in plan
4. Register: `~/.pilot/bin/pilot register-plan "<plan_path>" "COMPLETE" 2>/dev/null || true`
5. Read `Type:` field.
   <!-- CC-ONLY -->
   Bugfix: `Skill(skill='spec-bugfix-verify', args='<plan-path>')` | Otherwise: `Skill(skill='spec-verify', args='<plan-path>')`
   <!-- /CC-ONLY -->
   <!-- CODEX-START
   Codex has no callable phase-dispatch tool. Bugfix: continue immediately with the `$spec-bugfix-verify` skill instructions using arguments: `<plan-path>` | Otherwise: continue immediately with the `$spec-verify` skill instructions using arguments: `<plan-path>`.
   CODEX-END -->

### 3.1 Migration/Refactoring Additions (only when `## Feature Inventory` is present in the plan)

**Before starting any migration task:** Locate Feature Inventory in plan. If missing: STOP. Verify all features mapped.

**During each migration task:** Read old files, create checklist of functions/behaviors, verify each exists in new code, test with same inputs.

**Red flags (STOP):** Feature Inventory missing, old functions not in any task, "Out of Scope" items that should be migrated, tests pass but functionality missing vs old code.
