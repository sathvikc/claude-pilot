## Step 6: Check for Console Annotation Feedback (Before Approval)

**⛔ Run this BEFORE Step 7 (approval).** Check if the user has annotated the plan in the Console's Specifications tab. Annotations auto-save to JSON — no "Send Feedback" button needed.

1. Derive annotation file: `docs/plans/.annotations/<plan-filename>.json`
2. Read the annotation file with the Read tool. If the file doesn't exist, treat as `NO_FEEDBACK`. If it exists, check whether `planAnnotations` has any entries (`FEEDBACK_EXISTS`) or is empty/missing (`NO_FEEDBACK`).
3. **If `FEEDBACK_EXISTS`:** Each annotation in `planAnnotations` has `originalText` (selected passage) and `text` (user's note). Incorporate into plan, delete the annotation file via `rm -f "<annotation-file-path>"` (e.g. `rm -f "docs/plans/.annotations/2026-03-26-my-bug.json"`), note changes. Proceed to Step 7.
4. **If `NO_FEEDBACK`:** proceed directly to Step 7.
