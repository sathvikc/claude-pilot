# /spec-bugfix-plan - Bugfix Planning Phase

**Phase 1 (bugfix).** Investigates root cause, creates lean fix plan, gets approval.

**Input:** Bug description (new) or plan path (continue unapproved)
**Output:** Approved bugfix plan at `docs/plans/YYYY-MM-DD-<slug>.md` with `Type: Bugfix`
<!-- CC-ONLY -->
**Next:** On approval → `Skill(skill='spec-implement', args='<plan-path>')`
<!-- /CC-ONLY -->
<!-- CODEX-START
**Next:** On approval → continue immediately with the `$spec-implement` skill instructions using arguments: `<plan-path>`.
CODEX-END -->

**Note:** This skill is invoked when the user types `/spec "<bug description>"` — they chose the full spec workflow. For a bugfix workflow without a plan file, users invoke `/fix` directly (separate user-facing command). The two are distinct entry points — honour the user's choice.

## Resuming an Unapproved Plan

When the argument ends with `.md`: read the plan, check `Status:` and `Approved:`. Resume from wherever planning left off:

- No investigation yet → Step 2 (Investigation)
- Has investigation, no tasks → Step 3 (Plan the Fix)
- Complete but unapproved → Step 6 (Approval)

---

## Iron Laws

```
1. NO FIXES WITHOUT ROOT CAUSE — traced to file:line, explained WHY.
2. NO CODE WITHOUT A FAILING REPRODUCING TEST — the RED must exist first.
3. FIX AT THE SOURCE — not where the error appears.
4. ONE UNIFORM STRUCTURE — every bugfix plan has the same three tasks.
```

If Step 2 is incomplete, you cannot propose fixes. Symptom fixes are failure. Retroactive tests are failure. "I know the fix, I'll skip the test" is failure.

---

## Critical Constraints

- **NEVER write code during planning** — planning and implementation are separate phases
- **NEVER assume — verify by reading files.** Trace the bug to actual file:line.
- **Lean ≠ skipping steps.** Small bugs get short tasks, not fewer tasks. The three-task structure (Reproducing Test → Fix → Quality Gate) is non-negotiable.
- **Plan file is source of truth** — survives across auto-compaction cycles
<!-- CC-ONLY -->
- **ALWAYS use `AskUserQuestion` tool** for clarifications — never list numbered questions in plain text
<!-- /CC-ONLY -->
<!-- CODEX-START
- **ALWAYS use plain-text numbered options** for clarifications — never refer to the unavailable Claude question tool as callable in Codex
CODEX-END -->
- **⛔ If `PILOT_PLAN_QUESTIONS_ENABLED` is `"false"` (from Step 0),** skip all `AskUserQuestion` calls (Steps 2.1, 2.5 escalation, 3 approach selection). Make reasonable default assumptions (including selecting the recommended fix approach) and document them in the plan. Continue autonomously.

### Codex Bugfix Planning Speed Contract

For Codex, bugfix quality means a traced root cause, a reproducing RED test plan, and a source-level fix strategy. It does not mean exhaustive graph traversal.

- Reach the first complete bugfix plan before context reaches 35% unless the bug is not reproducible.
- Use a bounded investigation: one reproduction attempt path, at most one CodeGraph orientation call when the entry point is unknown, one Semble intent search, then targeted reads of the suspected files. Skip CodeGraph for docs, rules, markdown, config, UI copy, reviews of a known diff, or named paths.
- Run callers/callees/impact only after a likely root-cause function is known and the bug spans more than one component.
- Ask at most one bundled clarification prompt before the approval prompt. If the missing signal blocks reproduction, ask; otherwise record a Medium-confidence root cause and a verification task.
- Stop investigating once you can state `Root Cause: file:line — function() does X but should do Y`, name the RED test, and name the source file the fix must touch.
