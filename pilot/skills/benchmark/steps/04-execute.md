# Step 4 — Execute

<!-- CC-ONLY -->
Run the runner **in the background** so the user gets live status updates while it runs. Foreground bash blocks for the full duration (often 5-30 minutes) and shows nothing until the end — that's a bad UX, don't do it.
<!-- /CC-ONLY -->
<!-- CODEX-START
Run the runner with the Codex shell execution tool. If it yields a long-running session, keep the session id and poll it for status; otherwise read the command output directly when it completes.
CODEX-END -->

## Launch

<!-- CC-ONLY -->
Use the `Bash` tool with `run_in_background=true`. Capture the returned task ID; you will need it to read output and check completion.

```
Bash(
  command="PYTHONPATH=~/.claude/skills/benchmark uv run python -m scripts.runner \
    --config benchmarks/<target-name>/evals.json \
    --skip-permissions",
  description="Run benchmark in background",
  run_in_background=true,
)
```
<!-- /CC-ONLY -->
<!-- CODEX-START
```bash
PYTHONPATH=~/.agents/skills/benchmark uv run python -m scripts.runner \
  --config benchmarks/<target-name>/evals.json \
  --skip-permissions --agent codex --grader-timeout 600
```
CODEX-END -->

<!-- CC-ONLY -->
That's it for arguments — defaults handle the rest. The runner reads the target skill's `model:` frontmatter and uses that for both executor and grader. Rules targets and skills without a `model:` field fall back to `claude-sonnet-4-6`.
<!-- /CC-ONLY -->
<!-- CODEX-START
That's it for arguments — defaults handle the rest. With `--agent codex`, the runner installs skills in `.agents/skills/<name>/`, composes rules into root `AGENTS.md`, and omits `--model` unless you pass one explicitly so Codex uses its active default model.
CODEX-END -->

<!-- CODEX-START
Codex runs happen in freshly-created temp directories, which are intentionally not git repositories. The runner adds `--skip-git-repo-check` to each child `codex exec` automatically; if you see `Not inside a trusted directory and --skip-git-repo-check was not specified`, update or fix the runner before rerunning the benchmark.
CODEX-END -->

**Why `uv run`:** every Python invocation in this project uses `uv run` — no system `python` or `python3`. It ensures the right interpreter and dependency set.

<!-- CC-ONLY -->
**Why `--skip-permissions`:** all benchmark runs need this flag because `claude -p` is spawned non-interactively (no terminal to answer permission prompts). It passes `--dangerously-skip-permissions` to every executor and grader subprocess. Only use in a trusted environment — the grader reads arbitrary file paths passed by evals.json.
<!-- /CC-ONLY -->
<!-- CODEX-START
**Why `--skip-permissions`:** all benchmark runs need this flag because `codex exec` is spawned non-interactively. It configures full-access sandbox permissions for every executor and grader subprocess. Only use in a trusted environment — the grader reads arbitrary file paths passed by evals.json.
CODEX-END -->

<!-- CODEX-START
**Why `--grader-timeout 600`:** Codex graders reopen transcripts and generated files from disk, and artifact-heavy evals can exceed the 300s default even when executor runs succeed. Prefer starting Codex comparisons with 600s so a single slow grader does not force a full rerun just to produce `grading.json`.
CODEX-END -->

## Surface the plan header to the user immediately

<!-- CC-ONLY -->
As soon as the runner starts, it prints a plan header (config path, target, output dir, evals × configs × runs, models). Read it with `BashOutput` and relay it verbatim to the user so they see the scope and ETA up front:

```
BashOutput(bash_id="<task_id>")
```

Then send a brief intro to the user, e.g.:

> Benchmark started. **Plan:** 6 evals × 2 configs × 1 run = 12 runs, executor=<model>. Estimated ~30-45 min. I'll surface progress as runs complete and the final summary when it finishes.

## Status updates while it runs

The runner emits these stdout patterns to watch for:

| Pattern | When | What to do |
|---------|------|-----------|
| `[N/M] ✓ eval-X config run-N  78.3s, 12.4k tok  · ... ETA Xm` | Per completed run | Once you've seen >2 of these, you have an ETA — relay the latest ETA to the user when they ask or every ~5 min. |
| `· [snapshot Xs elapsed] N done · M in-flight · K queued · F failed` | Every 30s while in-flight | Use these as quick "still alive" pings. |
| `✗ eval-X config run-N  failed: <reason>` | On run failure | Surface immediately to the user — failures often mean config issues (timeout, missing agent CLI, grader-no-output). |

<!-- CC-ONLY -->
**You will be notified automatically when the background task completes** — do NOT sleep, poll, or proactively check on its progress. Continue with other work or respond to the user's questions in the meantime. When the user asks "how's it going?", call `BashOutput(bash_id=...)` to fetch the latest lines and summarize them.
<!-- /CC-ONLY -->
<!-- CODEX-START
If the shell tool returns a running session id, poll that session for the latest lines when the user asks "how's it going?" or when the session completes.
CODEX-END -->

## When the runner completes

The runner's tail of output includes a summary block:

```
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Benchmark complete in 33m14s  (12 ok, 0 failed, 0 skipped)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  With Skill                   ok 6/6  avg 110.5s, 568k tok total
  Without Skill                ok 6/6  avg 78.2s, 138k tok total
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
Wrote benchmarks/<target>/runs/<ts>/benchmark.json
```

Read the final output and:
1. Quote the summary block to the user
2. Compute and surface the headline `delta.pass_rate` from `benchmark.json` (signed string like `+0.50`)
3. Note any per-eval outliers if `stddev > 0.3`

## Flags (override the defaults when you have a reason)

| Flag | Default | When to override |
|------|---------|------------------|
| `--runs N` | `1` | `2-3` only when measuring variance — N runs are now parallelized across workers, so wall time grows sub-linearly. |
| `--model <id>` | Claude: skill frontmatter → `claude-sonnet-4-6`; Codex: active Codex default | Cross-model comparison. Claude accepts `opus`/`sonnet`/`haiku` aliases or explicit `claude-...` IDs. Codex passes the value directly to `codex exec --model`; omit it to use the active Codex model. |
| `--grader-model <id>` | same as `--model` | Run the grader at a different tier (rare — pairing them avoids "smart writer judged by dumb grader" artifacts). |
| `--configs with,without` | both | Smoke test one side. |
| `--workers N` | `4` | Drop to `2` when running opus to be kinder to rate limits. For small eval sets bump to `min(total_runs, 8)` so every run lands in the first wave (3 evals × 2 configs × 1 run = 6 → `--workers 6` cuts wall time roughly in half). The runner submits one pool task per (eval, config, run_idx) so workers stay saturated. |
<!-- CC-ONLY -->
| `--no-isolate-global` | off | Disable auto-hiding of globally-installed counterparts during the run. Claude hides matching `~/.claude/rules/<basename>.md` and `~/.claude/skills/<name>/`. Use only when you want to measure the target **in addition to** global guidance. |
<!-- /CC-ONLY -->
<!-- CODEX-START
| `--no-isolate-global` | off | Disable auto-hiding of globally-installed counterparts during the run. Codex hides matching `~/.agents/skills/<name>/`. Use only when you want to measure the target **in addition to** global guidance. |
CODEX-END -->
| `--restore-hidden` | off | Exit after recovering any `.pilot-bench-hidden-*` files left by a crashed prior run (normally swept automatically on every startup). |
| `--timeout <sec>` | `600` | Bump for slow models or large prompts. |
| `--grader-timeout <sec>` | `300` | Bump if `grader-no-output` failures appear. |
<!-- CODEX-START
| `--grader-timeout 600` | override | Recommended for Codex file-writing evals; it prevents a successful executor run from becoming an unusable partial result because the grader timed out while reading artifacts. |
CODEX-END -->
| `--output <dir>` | `benchmarks/<target>/runs/<ts>/` | Override when you want a specific output path. |

## Failure handling

When you see `failed.json` referenced (or a `✗ failed:` line):

- `reason: timeout` — bump `--timeout` or reduce `--runs`.
- `reason: no-result-event` — stream-json stream was malformed. Inspect `outputs/transcript.jsonl` for the raw stream.
<!-- CC-ONLY -->
- `reason: claude-cli-not-found` — the `claude` CLI isn't on PATH. Install Claude Code first.
<!-- /CC-ONLY -->
<!-- CODEX-START
- `reason: codex-cli-not-found` — the `codex` CLI isn't on PATH. Install Codex CLI first.
- `reason: codex-exec-failed` with `Not inside a trusted directory and --skip-git-repo-check was not specified` — the runner is missing the Codex temp-directory trust flag. Add `--skip-git-repo-check` to executor and grader `codex exec` commands, then rerun.
- `reason: grader-failed` with `timed out after 300 seconds` — rerun with `--grader-timeout 600`; the executor output is usually usable, but the missing `grading.json` makes the aggregate incomplete.
CODEX-END -->
- `reason: grader-no-output` / `grader-invalid-json` — the grader subagent failed. Retry or bump `--grader-model` a tier.

A few failed runs do not abort the rest of the benchmark — each writes its own `failed.json` and the runner continues. Surface failures to the user but only stop everything if more than half are failing.

## Commit the snapshot

Once the benchmark is stable (you've got a result you trust), commit `benchmarks/<target>/runs/<timestamp>/benchmark.json` as a baseline snapshot. Future runs can compare against it.

## Exit

Go to Step 5 (present findings & iterate).
