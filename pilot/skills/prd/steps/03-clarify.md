## Step 3: Ask Clarifying Questions

**⛔ ALWAYS use the `AskUserQuestion` tool** — never list numbered questions in plain text. Each question gets its own entry with 2-4 predefined options users can select. This provides a structured form UI that is much easier to answer than freeform text.

**One question at a time, building on previous answers.** Each `AskUserQuestion` call focuses on a single decision point, and the next question must follow from what the user just said — not from a fixed checklist. If the user's answer exposes a new assumption or constraint, pivot there instead of marching through pre-planned topics.

**⛔ Skip obvious questions.** Do not ask anything already answered by the one-line idea, the codebase exploration in Step 1, or earlier answers in this conversation. The goal is to surface what the user hasn't thought about yet, not to collect a standard intake form.

**⛔ Code-first rule.** Before each question, ask "can the codebase answer this?" If yes — read the code. Use `codegraph_context`, `codegraph_search`, `codegraph_explore`, or Probe to resolve "how does X currently work / where does Y live / what's the existing pattern for Z". Only ask the user about things code can't tell you: purpose, priorities, audience, constraints, scope boundaries, behavioural expectations not yet encoded. Asking the user about facts the code already encodes wastes their time and signals you didn't explore.

Coverage areas (ask only where genuinely unclear):
- **Purpose** — what's the core outcome the user wants?
- **Users** — who benefits from this? What's their workflow today?
- **Constraints** — timeline, technical limitations, existing architecture
- **Success criteria** — how will we know this works?
- **Scope boundaries** — what's explicitly NOT included?

**Question format:** Every question must have 2-4 concrete options with trade-offs. Use `multiSelect: true` when choices aren't mutually exclusive. Include an "Other" option when the user might have a direction you haven't considered.

**Per-question mode flexibility — slip into prose when needed.** Default is structured `AskUserQuestion`. But if the user's last answer opens a new unknown that doesn't have 2-4 obvious options yet — or if their answer is a question back to you ("what would you do here?") — drop into 1-2 prose turns to explore it (Ideate-style), then return to structured questions for the next decision point. The phase boundary between Ideate and Clarify is a default, not a wall. Don't force four options onto a question that genuinely needs open-ended exploration; equally, don't drift into endless prose when the next decision is a clean A/B/C choice.

**Principles:**
- Challenge assumptions — "You mentioned X. Have you considered Y?"
- Surface trade-offs — "That's possible, but it comes at the cost of Z"
- Be constructive but strategic — don't be a yes-man
- If the idea has red flags or scope creep risks, raise them now
- Typically 3-6 questions total, depending on complexity — stop asking once you have 90% of the spec
